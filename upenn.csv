UPenn	Friendship and Your Brain	Michael Platt, Professor of Psychology<br />Friendship, charity, and empathy: How do these profoundly human feelings arise from the coordinated actions of our brains, bodies, and genes? What are the roots of the social emotions in other animals? How does our social environment get “under our skin” to shape our lives and livelihood? Using his decades of experience studying the behavior and biology of rhesus macaques, Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor Michael Platt will discuss the new science of friendship and what these monkeys can teach us about ourselves.Expert faculty from the University of Pennsylvania shed light on their research at the Penn Science Café.

UPenn	Hollywood’s Past and Future	Peter Decherney, Professor of English<br />Hollywood has dominated global screens and imaginations for more than 100 years. Against the odds, movie studios have weathered economic crises, disruptive new technologies, and powerful competition. Peter Decherney, a professor of English and cinema studies, will draw on his new book <em>Hollywood: A Very Short Introduction</em> to offer five theses on Hollywood’s tenacity. What is the recipe that has allowed Hollywood to adjust to new challenges? And what can our media past tell us about the current moment and future?Presented by Penn Arts and Sciences in partnership with the Office of University Communications, Penn Café events are free and open to the public, but RSVPs are encouraged.

UPenn	Decoding Your Mental GPS: Transcendental Numbers in the Brain	Vijay Balasubramanian, Cathy and Mark Lasry Professor of Physics and Astronomy<br />The brain uses specialized neurons known as place and grid cells to keep track of location. The discovery of the latter earned researchers a Nobel Prize last year, but the way the brain encodes and decodes this information is still a mystery. Now, a team of University of Pennsylvania researchers, led by Vijay Balasubramanian, has a theory for how grid cells work together to pinpoint an organism’s location on a mental map. He’ll explain how the brain’s many overlapping grids are connected by a special ratio, organizing them into something akin to the decimal system.Expert faculty from the University of Pennsylvania shed light on their research at the Penn Science Café.
