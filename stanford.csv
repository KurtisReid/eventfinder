Stanford Univerbsity	Red Horse: Drawings of the Battle of the Little Bighorn	This exhibition presents 12 ledger drawings by Red Horse, a Minneconjou Lakota Sioux warrior who fought against Custer and the 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in what is now Eastern Montana, in June 1876. Selected from a group of 42 drawings that chronicle the battle, the images depict scenes such as combat on horseback, wounded and dead warriors and soldiers, and Native Americans leaving the battlefield. Red Horse: Drawings of the Battle of the Little Bighorn brings together key collaborators from Stanford and its communities to explore these indigenous-centered illustrations from diverse perspectives. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the exhibition highlights the dynamic ways Red Horse’s drawings continue to function as an artist’s narrative of this important moment in American and Native American history. The Red Horse drawings are on loan from the National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution, Department of Anthropology. 	January 16, 2016	Arts, International, Exhibition	http://museum.stanford.edu/view/exhibition_sched_new.html#Consumer	
Stanford Univerbsity	Wanting More: Picturing the Rise of Consumer Culture	The artists represented in this exhibition used their cameras to look askance at the expansion of consumer culture in the 20th century. Some inspect the products of mass manufacture intensely, others take a close look at the advertising systems invented to move goods quickly from factory to home. Together, these works highlight the influx of prefabricated objects and marketing campaigns over the last century and point to their underpinning promise (so often unfulfilled) of a prosperous life. 	January 13, 2016	Arts, International, Environment, Exhibition	http://gender.stanford.edu/events/susan-groag-bell-1926-2015-pioneer-womens-history

Stanford Univerbsity	Energy Seminar: Jon Krosnick, Stanford University, American Public Opinion on Climate Change: The Latest Measurements	Talk Abstract:During the past two decades, headlines on newspapers across the country have proclaimed such things as: "Scientists and the American Public Disagree Sharply over Global Warming." And one U.S. Senator has pronounced that the global warming issue is "dead" in the minds of Americans. Meanwhile, emissions reduction bills, such as Waxman-Markey, have been defeated in the Congress.  Is it really true that Americans reject the opinions of natural scientists on climate change?In this presentation, Professor Krosnick will describe findings from a series of national surveys that he has designed and conducted since 1996, tracking what Americans do and do not believe on this issue and what they do and do not want to have done about it. Surprising results challenge many widely-held presumptions about public opinion and help set the stage for understanding how future legislation on climate change may fare.
**Join us at the Energy Social: 5:20-6:20pm, Huang Foyer**The social is open to Stanford faculty, staff, and students.

Stanford Univerbsity	DANCE STUDIES LECTURE: Imani Kai Johnson on "The Global Cypher? Black Sociality, Soulful Allies, and a Truly Global Culture"	JAN 25 at 5:30-7PM | ROOM 125, MEMORIAL HALL | FREE & OPEN TO THE PUBLIC | RSVP BY EMAILING RACHEL AT RCARRICO@STANFORD.EDU
The Stanford Colloquium on Dance Studies presents “The Global Cypher? Black Sociality, Soulful Allies, and a Truly Global Culture” with Imani Kai Johnson, Assistant Professor of Dance, University of California-Riverside. In this talk, Dr. Imani Kai Johnson will present excerpted material from her manuscript Dark Matter in B-Boying Cyphers. Her work explores Africanist aesthetics within b-boying culture, and uses the metaphor of dark matter--the physics concept for invisible matter-- to discuss the substantive impact of invisibilized black culture. This talk builds on previously published work on the global context of breaking by examining the stakes of a discourse of globality, and the frictions of working across differences to enact moments of global connection within cyphers.
The Stanford Colloquium on Dance Studies is sponsored by the Mellon “Dance Studies in/and the Humanities” initiative and is generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Additional funding provided by Stanford’s Center for Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity, and administrative support provided by the Department of Theater & Performance Studies.

Stanford Univerbsity	Film Screening: Delicatessen, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 1991	Delicatessen (1991, Jean-Pierre Jeunet et Marc Caro, France)
Tuesday, 26th January 2016
6:30pm, Building 380, Room 380Y
Introduced by Samuel Gibson
Delicatessen unfolds the stories and conflicts of the neighbors of an isolated and mysterious building in a rural and post-apocalyptic 1950’s France, where food is scarce and grain is used as currency while animals are being hunted to extinction.The inhabitants of it just have one obsession: to feed themselves. The owner of the building, Clapet, also owns the butchery located at the first floor. Thanks to a very peculiar methodology, he keeps his leadership over the neighbors since he is the food provider.When a new tenant, who used to work at the circus, arrives to the building, he alters the life of this eccentric community.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro dazzled European critics and audiences with this fantastic, uncanny, dark, hilarious, and unique film.

Stanford Univerbsity	Quaker Traditions of Nonviolence, Pacifism, and Activism: A lecture by David Hartsough	The Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, broke away from the Church of England and in 1660 formally declared to King Charles II: "We utterly deny all outward wars and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretense whatever; this is our testimony to the whole world.  The Spirit of Christ . . . which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world."  Since then the Quakers have developed rich traditions of thought and action around pacifism, nonviolent struggle, and commitment to social justice. David Hartsough will introduce the history of Quaker thought and action around violence, nonviolence, and justice, and he will share highlights from his lifelong activism.
Author of Waging Peace: The Global Adventures of a Lifelong Activist, Mr. Hartsough is Executive Director of Peaceworkers  and Co-Founder of Nonviolent Peaceforce and of World Beyond War. He worked for many years with the American Friends Service Committee.

Stanford Univerbsity	How We Write: The Varieties of Writing Experience	How We Write: The Varieties of Writing Experience is based on the series of “How I Write” public conversations with faculty and other advanced writers conducted by Hilton Obenzinger at Stanford University since 2002. These conversations explored the nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing with prominent novelists, poets, historians, physicists, critics, playwrights, philosophers, anthropologists and neuroscientists. How do writers get ideas? How do they launch into a project? Fashion arguments? Create images? Craft stories? What do they do when they get blocked? What are their strategies for revising their work? How We Write celebrates a craft that delights and dismays each of us.	January 27, 2016	Arts, Class, Humanities, Literary, Health / Wellness	http://museum.stanford.edu/visit/public_tours.html	
Stanford Univerbsity	Exploring Life in the Human Body through Poetry	What does it mean to not only exist, but to thrive, inside one’s body, in the 21st century, with the longest lifetime expectancy in human history? By focusing on poems that engage and challenge both the physical aspects, and the mysteries of the human body, this class will empower us to deepen awareness and shed light on our innate understanding of ourselves. Studies have revealed that expressive writing and therapeutic poetry writing can show statistically significant improvements in “physical health, reductions in visits to physicians, and increased immune system function,” as well as “increase insight, self-awareness, and adaptive healthy functioning” (McArdle & Byrt 2001).
This 3 session discussion-based and creatively-generative class will be divided into 3 parts: the devotional, the diminutive, and the transformative. After reading and discussing published poems, we will address these 3 aspects of life in the human body by writing poems that are grounded in the concrete and physical world.
Instructor: Jacques Rancourt was a 2012-2014 Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford and a 2011-2012 Halls Emerging Artist Fellow at the Wisconsin Institute for Creative Writing. His poems have appeared in over fifty nationally-recognized literary journals, including the *Kenyon Review, Virginia Quarterly Review, New England Review, and Best New Poets 2014.

This event sponsored by the Pegasus Physician Writers at Stanford.
Drs. Astro & Danielle Teller know better than most that finding the right partner in life doesn't always happen the first time around. Through their own divorces they learned how widely held cultrual assumptions and misinformation that nobody thinks to question-what they refer to as "sacred cows"- create unnecessary heartache for people who already are suffering through a terrible time. Combining the rigor that has established them as leaders in their respective fields along with a dose of good-natured humor, the Tellers ask readers to take a fresh look at one of our most cherished and misunderstood institutions.

Stanford Univerbsity	Deeply Divided: Racial Politics and Social Movements in Post-War America	By any measure, the United States has not been more divided politically or economically in the last hundred years than it is now. How have we gone from the striking bipartisanship and relative economic equality of the post–World War II period to the extreme inequality and savage partisan divisions of today? In this talk, Stanford sociologist Douglas McAdam will seek to answer this question. He will argue that party politics alone is not responsible for the mess we find ourselves in. Instead, it was the ongoing interaction of social movements and parties that, over time, pushed Democrats and Republicans toward their ideological margins, undermining the postwar consensus in the process. The civil rights struggle and the white backlash it provoked reintroduced the centrifugal force of social movements into American politics, ushering in an especially active and sustained period of movement and party dynamism. Today’s tug of war between the Tea Party and the Republican establishment for control of the GOP is only the most recent example of this process. But economic inequality and political polarization are not the only significant trends in the contemporary United States. In July 2014, former President Jimmy Carter stunned an audience in Atlanta when he declared that “America no longer has a functioning democracy.” Even allowing for a bit of exaggeration, this is a third trend in the US that has not received sufficient attention. McAdam will close his talk by documenting some of the current threats to the health and well-being of American democracy and the things we can do to counteract the trend. Douglas McAdam, Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Sociology, Stanford
Douglas McAdam’s two main areas of research are the study of social movements and the racial politics in the United States. Among his best-known books are Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, 1930–1970, and Freedom Summer. His latest book, Deeply Divided, seeks to explain the origins of the deep political, economic, and racial divisions that are so evident in the US today. He was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 and received a PhD from the State University of New York at Albany.

Stanford Univerbsity	Walk This Way	There is compelling evidence that over the past 100 years the populations of industrialized countries have drifted away from the somatic heritage of their forbearers. We have adopted postural habits which are dramatically different from those used historically and still found in non-industrialized peoples today. The Gokhale Method (add register trademark) helps people in modern industrial society restore their natural posture and regain pain-free lives.
Day 1: introduces the art and science of healthy posture teaches the elements of healthy gait
Day 2: reinforces gait lessons learned in Day 1 explores yoga poses, dance movements, and exercises as extensions of healthy gait builds a workout using principles of healthy gait that can be used as an office break or exercise routine
Instructor: Esther Gokhale, creator of Gokhale Method. (www.GokhaleMethod.com) Ms. Gokhale's mission is to provide posture and movement re-education to help people eradicate unnecessary pain and live their best lives.

Stanford Univerbsity	Into the Forest: Landscape as Subject and Studio in 19th-Century France	This installation of prints, drawings, and photographs explores how French artists depicted the landscape in the modern age and approached making art “en plein air” (in the open air). The phenomenon of making art outdoors took shape in the early decades of the 19th century with the experimental Barbizon School of painters and fully flourished under the Impressionists. Exhibition highlights include photographs by painter James Tissot (1836–1902), a rare cliché-verre—a drawing reproduced using a photographic process—by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot (1796–1875), and prints by Camille Pissarro (1831–1903).

Stanford Univerbsity	John Hennessy: DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series	Join us for a conversation with Stanford University President John L. Hennessy, who joined Stanford’s faculty in 1977 as an assistant professor of electrical engineering. He rose through the academic ranks to full professorship in 1986 and was the inaugural Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from 1987 to 2004. He served as chair of computer science from 1994 to 1996 and, in 1996, was named dean of the School of Engineering.
In 1999, Hennessy was named provost, the university’s chief academic and financial officer. As provost, he continued his efforts to foster interdisciplinary activities in the biosciences and bioengineering and oversaw improvements in faculty and staff compensation. In October 2000, he was inaugurated as Stanford University’s 10th president.
A pioneer in computer architecture, in 1981, Hennessy drew together researchers to focus on a computer architecture known as RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), a technology that has revolutionized the computer industry by increasing performance while reducing costs. In addition to his role in basic research, Hennessy helped transfer this technology to industry. In 1984, he co-founded MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, which designs microprocessors.
Honored with many computing and engineering awards over his career, Hennessy is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences, and he is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
Hennessy earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University and his master’s and doctoral degrees in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Stanford Univerbsity	Faculty Lecture: Mark Braude on Speed and Power	Mark Braude, lecturer in Stanford’s departments of Art History, French, and History, discusses his curricular exhibition, Speed and Power. Drawn entirely from the Cantor’s collection, the works on view in this exhibition explore the intertwined issues of speed (physical acceleration) and power (social stratification) largely through the medium of photography, arguably the “fastest” means of representation that modern artists have at their disposal.

Stanford Univerbsity	Bernard Faure: "Giving the gods their due: Looking back at Japanese religion"	Paradoxically enough, the study of Japanese religion has recently neglected what should have been a key theme: its gods. A number of factors may explain that paradox. First, there is a lingering Durkheimian notion that religion is not primarily about the gods. Second, the notion that Buddhism is a religion without gods persists. Lastly, since the Meiji Restoration, there has been a widespread view that Buddhism and Shinto are the sole two Japanese religions, with the gods (kami) being the province of Shinto only.Needless to say, these conceptions are, at best, simplistic, and at worst, utterly misleading. Buddhism is replete with gods of all kinds, and the spectrum of Japanese religion includes much more than some monolithic Buddhism and Shinto. By examining a few deities that do not fall neatly into the "Buddhist" or "Shinto" categories, I will try to show that, far from being "moot" deities, they were, through most of Japanese history, part of the living reality of Japanese religion.

Stanford Univerbsity	The EU in Crisis: How Serious Is It?	Arguably, the EU finds itself in a major crisis, maybe the biggest since it was created more than half a century ago. There are at least five big challenges the organization has to cope with: the still unsolved Eurocrisis; imported terrorism and homegrown populism; a vastly unregulated mass immigraton; the possible exit of the UK; and an assertive Russia. While the EU is still a major success story – after it was established also as a result of the political disasters in the first half of the last century – it has to cope with providing solutions for the crises mentioned, and also to produce new, convincing narratives for a younger generation. Whether it will succeed, is so far unclear.
Klaus Segbers is Professor of Political Sciences at the Institute for East European Studies and the Department for Political Sciences at Freie Universitaet Berlin. In addition, Segbers is an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and Director of the Center for Global Politics at Freie Universitaet Berlin, the latter of which offers blended learning programs for students and professionals in China, Southeast Asia, Mena, Iran, and Russia. Klaus Segbers's research interests are: globalizing city regions; European and German external behavior; institutional changes in Russia and China; and structural limits of national governments' performances. He is a frequent commentator on German and international television and radio programs.	February 5, 2016	Uncategorized
