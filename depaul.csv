DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 23, 2016: Curating Your Teaching Portfolio: Selection and Reflection (Online) at Online	<p>You’ve taught courses, you’ve attended workshops, you’ve written (or thought about) your teaching philosophy, and you’ve fortified your CV, but your online teaching portfolio is still missing something important: teaching material. An e-portfolio can help define your professional identity online, but it can be challenging to select and arrange the stuff of a career to present a thoughtful and coherent whole. What do you need to include? What can you afford to leave out? How much explanation does it all require? Online attention spans are notoriously short, so an effective teaching portfolio provides carefully-selected artifacts of your teaching practice that complement the rest of your portfolio documents and invite visitors to learn about your work.
<br />This workshop offers you the opportunity to curate your teaching portfolio while exchanging feedback with other faculty members. Drawing on both teaching portfolio guides and the evolving pedagogy that helps students create effective portfolios at DePaul and many other universities, this workshop will guide you through the processes of selection and reflection to create a holistic picture of you as a teacher. After a review of some best practices, we’ll discuss how to align the various audiences and purposes your portfolio is intended for and the teaching material you have to work with. We’ll examine sample portfolios, go through a structured analysis of our own portfolio material, and work together to plan the next iteration of our online professional identities.
<br />By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:</p>

<p>Identify appropriate and engaging artifacts that reflect their teaching practice.
<br />Plan a revision of their teaching portfolios that integrate their artifacts into a coherent whole, supporting the claims of reflections and the teaching philosophy.
<br />Introduce teaching artifacts with reflective comments that take multiple audiences into account.</p>

<p>Format: This workshop is fully online and asynchronous, meaning that there are no face-to-face meetings. Participants must have reliable access to the Internet during the week of January 19-24, and should count on committing to approximately three hours in total to the workshop activities. After the end date, you will retain access to the materials and activities on the workshop's D2L site. Enrollment for this workshop is capped at 25 individuals.
<br />Who should participate?: In order to get the most out of the workshop activities, participants should already have drafted (or thought about) their teaching philosophy, and should have sample teaching materials on hand that they might choose to include in a teaching portfolio. This workshop will be useful to individuals considering making a digital teaching portfolio, those who are already in the process of creating their portfolio, as well as those who would like to revise or update an existing portfolio.
<br />This workshop will be facilitated by Mike Hernandez from the Writing, Rhetoric, and Discourse Department.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 25, 2016: Giving Back in Ghana: Thomas Awiapo's Story of Survival to Success at Library - Richardson Library Lincoln Park Campus	<p>~ RSVP by Jan. 22 to <a href="mailto:ksulli47@depaul.edu">ksulli47@depaul.edu</a>
<br />~ Brown bag lunch (drinks & dessert provided!)</p>

<p>Thomas Awiapo, a global solidarity coordinator for Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Ghana, shares his story of survival & success with us at this casual, brown bag/BYO lunch event (drinks & dessert provided).</p>

<p>Growing up in a small African village in Ghana, Thomas was orphaned before the age of 10 and left on his own to struggle for survival. He was the second of four brothers; his youngest two brothers died of malnutrition and lack of care.</p>

<p>His search for food led him to an elementary school, where he was fed a small meal every day. He survived, studied, and eventually won scholarships to attend college. He later earned a master’s degree from California State University.</p>

<p>Today, he works for CRS training community leaders throughout Ghana, where he lives with his wife and four children. His story of initiative and his joyful presence has brought inspiration to thousands of people in the U.S.</p>

<p>Organized by DePaul University's Catholic Campus Ministry (CCM)</p>

<p>Cosponsored by DePaul University's Center for World Catholicism & Intercultural Theology (CWCIT)</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 25, 2016: Islam, Islamophobia, and the Soft Prejudice of Liberalism at Cortelyou Commons	<p>Date: Monday, January 25, 2016
<br />Location: Cortelyou Commons (2324 N. Fremont St.)
<br />Title:"Islam, Islamophobia, and the Soft Prejudice of Liberalism"
<br />Descriptions: In recent yeras, liberal lions in the media, academia, and government have increasingly raised their voices about what they see as an Islamic threat. To deflect accusations of prejudice and Western triumphalism, they couch their discourses in language that targets Islam's foreign "ism" affix: Islamism. This narrative is of immense appeal to neoconservatives and progressives alike. But it's not without consequences. In a provocative evening discussion at DePaul University's Cortelyou Commons, author and scholar Nathan Lean will examine the ways in which Islamophobia has become a byproduct of Western liberalism, and entrenched itself among a group of people that have long claimed to champion multiculturalism and religious freedom.</p>

<p>Biography: Nathan Lean is the Director of Research at Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative, and the author of The Islamophobia Industry. He is a leading expert on anti-Muslim prejudice. His writings have appeared in the New Republic, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, Salon, CNN, and other popular outlets.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 26, 2016: Jessica Chiarella reading at Library - Richardson Library Lincoln Park Campus	<p>Please join the Department of English in celebrating the release of recent DePaul MAWP graduate Jessica Chiarella's first novel, AND AGAIN, on Tuesday, January 26th, 6 p.m. in Richardson 115</p>

<p>AND AGAIN is the story of four terminally-ill patients who are given new, cloned bodies as part of a pilot program called SUBlife. While the “SUBs” are exact replicas of the patients’ former bodies, they are also genetically perfect, spared the onslaught of environmental damage that accompanies a normal life. Their vision is perfect. Old injuries disappear. Food tastes different. Scars, tattoos, and even the muscle memory they have always taken for granted is now gone. Their lives are saved, but their physical identities have been wiped away.</p>

<p>The novel follows these characters as they reenter their lives and find that they have been both restored, and unmade, by this medical miracle. Hannah, an artistic prodigy, discovers she can no longer paint. David, a congressman, attempts to hide his transformation from the public even as he continues to grapple with his old habits. Connie, an actress whose bombshell looks are restored after a protracted illness, attempts to navigate an industry obsessed with physical beauty. And Linda, who spent eight years paralyzed after an auto accident, finds she can no longer connect with the family she once loved. Throughout the following year, their return to health proves fraught with unbelievable rewards, and unimaginable risks.</p>

<p>"And Again is a moving and beautifully crafted novel about the frailty of identity, the illusion of control, and the enduring power of love. A fantastic debut."-Laila Lalami, author of The Moor's Account, Pulitzer Prize finalist and longlisted for the Man Booker Prize</p>

<p>A native of the Chicago area, Jessica Chiarella is a graduate of DePaul's MAWP program and is currently a student in the University of California, Riverside's MFA in Creative Writing program.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 26, 2016: Islam, Islamophobia, and the Soft Prejudice of Liberalism at Cortelyou Commons	<p>Date: Monday, January 25, 2016
<br />Location: Cortelyou Commons (2324 N. Fremont St.)
<br />Title:"Islam, Islamophobia, and the Soft Prejudice of Liberalism"
<br />Descriptions: In recent yeras, liberal lions in the media, academia, and government have increasingly raised their voices about what they see as an Islamic threat. To deflect accusations of prejudice and Western triumphalism, they couch their discourses in language that targets Islam's foreign "ism" affix: Islamism. This narrative is of immense appeal to neoconservatives and progressives alike. But it's not without consequences. In a provocative evening discussion at DePaul University's Cortelyou Commons, author and scholar Nathan Lean will examine the ways in which Islamophobia has become a byproduct of Western liberalism, and entrenched itself among a group of people that have long claimed to champion multiculturalism and religious freedom.</p>

<p>Biography: Nathan Lean is the Director of Research at Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative, and the author of The Islamophobia Industry. He is a leading expert on anti-Muslim prejudice. His writings have appeared in the New Republic, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, Salon, CNN, and other popular outlets.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 26, 2016: Jessica Chiarella reading at Library - Richardson Library Lincoln Park Campus	<p>Please join the Department of English in celebrating the release of recent DePaul MAWP graduate Jessica Chiarella's first novel, AND AGAIN, on Tuesday, January 26th, 6 p.m. in Richardson 115</p>

<p>AND AGAIN is the story of four terminally-ill patients who are given new, cloned bodies as part of a pilot program called SUBlife. While the “SUBs” are exact replicas of the patients’ former bodies, they are also genetically perfect, spared the onslaught of environmental damage that accompanies a normal life. Their vision is perfect. Old injuries disappear. Food tastes different. Scars, tattoos, and even the muscle memory they have always taken for granted is now gone. Their lives are saved, but their physical identities have been wiped away.</p>

<p>The novel follows these characters as they reenter their lives and find that they have been both restored, and unmade, by this medical miracle. Hannah, an artistic prodigy, discovers she can no longer paint. David, a congressman, attempts to hide his transformation from the public even as he continues to grapple with his old habits. Connie, an actress whose bombshell looks are restored after a protracted illness, attempts to navigate an industry obsessed with physical beauty. And Linda, who spent eight years paralyzed after an auto accident, finds she can no longer connect with the family she once loved. Throughout the following year, their return to health proves fraught with unbelievable rewards, and unimaginable risks.</p>

<p>"And Again is a moving and beautifully crafted novel about the frailty of identity, the illusion of control, and the enduring power of love. A fantastic debut."-Laila Lalami, author of The Moor's Account, Pulitzer Prize finalist and longlisted for the Man Booker Prize</p>

<p>A native of the Chicago area, Jessica Chiarella is a graduate of DePaul's MAWP program and is currently a student in the University of California, Riverside's MFA in Creative Writing program.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 28, 2016: Dimensions of Communication at DePaul Center (DPC)	<p>Explore the discipline of communication through faculty and student presentations ‘powered’ by the global phenomenon PechaKucha20x20 — 20 images, 20 seconds per image.</p>

<p>What is PechaKucha 20x20?
<br />Roughly translated as ‘chit-chat’ in Japanese, the PechaKucha (say pe-chahk’-cha) presentation format was created in 2003 by a group of Tokyo architectural designers as a concise way to showcase their work to the public. These first meetings included networking and socializing, and soon the PechaKucha Night (PKN) was born. Nearly twelve years and 700 cities later, PKNs are a worldwide phenomenon where artists, activists, musi- cians, academics, and creatives come together and present their work in a social environment. To learn more about PechaKucha 20x20, visit pechakucha.org.</p>

<p>About the PechaKuchas</p>

<p>Shana Bahemat, Senior
<br />Intercultural Communication</p>

<p>Growing with History</p>

<p>Shana’s pechakucha is about understanding her identity as an Iranian woman while breaking the stereotype of Middle Eastern women that is per- ceived in the West. She celebrates political and social change through the voices of Iranian women by emphasizing the strength in their resistance. Her presentation will begin with a personal poem followed by analysis and a brief description of Iran’s political history.</p>

<p>Jill Hopke, Assistant Professor
<br />Journalism</p>

<p>Climate Activists Took to Social Media for Paris Climate Talks but Who are They Reaching? And, Why It Matters</p>

<p>In December 2015, representatives of 195 nations meeting in Paris for the Conference of the Parties (COP21) set an ambitious goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the mid-century. During the talks climate activists took to social media to get out their message on climate justice, but did they reach people on social media who are not already supporters of action on climate change? Hopke’s analysis of social media during the climate summit explores interaction between climate activists and the industry most closely associated with carbon emissions: oil and gas. She also discusses the implications for future climate action and our collective ability to live up to the goals set at COP21.</p>

<p>Daniel Makagon, Associate Professor
<br />Intercultural Communication</p>

<p>Screams from the Basement: DIY Punk Shows in the USA</p>

<p>Makagon’s pechakucha explores the development of a DIY punk touring network in the US, focusing on the shift from regional shows featuring local bands to more organized national touring options. More specifically, the transformation of the house as a private space to a pseudo-public show space for local punks to do DIY is discussed.</p>

<p>Jason Martin, Assistant Professor
<br />Journalism
<br />Jessica Gall Myrick, Assistant Professor, The Media School, Indiana University</p>

<p>How Young Uninsured Americans Respond to Obamacare News Coverage: Why Journalists’ Choice of Examples Matter</p>

<p>Martin and Myrick’s study is the first large-scale interdisciplinary merger of political communication and health communication theory in a critical real-world empirical context. They explore how journalists’ choices in reporting online news affects how people think, feel and act regarding their own health – and subsequently, how those effects hold important consequences for public health. Their online experiment (N=1,056) found that the positivity or negativity of the case studies, or exemplars, that journalists choose to include have direct effects on young uninsured Americans. The results highlight the important role journalists play in communicating the realities of complicated legislation and public health issues.</p>

<p>Lexa Murphy, Professor
<br />Organizational and Multicultural Communication</p>

<p>When Lives Are on the Line: Communicating in High-Reliability Organizations</p>

<p>Murphy’s pechakucha will focus on her work with high-stakes communication within organizations such as hospital emergency rooms.</p>

<p>Sherri Ter Molen, Adjunct Instructor
<br />Intercultural Communication</p>

<p>Black American, Heart Korean: Non-Korean Identities in U.S. Korean Meetup Groups</p>

<p>Meetup.com is a social networking site that boasts nearly 14,000 local interest-based groups worldwide including more than 50 Korean language and culture Meetup groups in the United States. Ter Molen’s ethnographic study recorded the lived experiences of non-Korean members of these groups to explore why Korean culture resonates with them to the extent that they appropriate Korean cultural symbols and seek out other Koreanophiles with whom they create new meanings. Most importantly, her study seeks to understand how their participation in Korean cultural activities shapes their own identities.</p>

<p>Abby Schultz, Junior
<br />Communication and Media</p>

<p>Healing Water: A Narrative for My Dear Friend H20</p>

<p>Schultz has been a fish her whole life; the mental and physical healing power of water is something to which only swimmers can attest. Finding peace in the water always came easy to Schultz, but after a scary knee injury she struggled for years on her way back upstream. Until she dove back in.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 28, 2016: Naming Jesus as "Healer" in Africa at Student Center (Lincoln Park)	<p>6:00pm Reception
<br />6:30pm Presentation/Discussion</p>

<p>The Gospels describe Jesus as “the way, the truth, and the life.” CWCIT's visiting scholar Laurenti Magesa argues that, for the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa, the best of these images is Jesus “the Life,” and this is best described as “the Healer.” In Jesus’ life, teaching, death, and resurrection, he embodies the African worldview of ongoing healing & life’s flourishing. “Jesus the Healer” also encompasses the images of the Way and the Truth, in that they lead to and serve Life. </p>

<p>About the Speaker
<br />Rev. Laurenti Magesa is a groundbreaking theologian from Tanzania whose work has redefined the study of African Catholicism. Before Magesa, most scholarship on Catholicism in Africa had been written by Europeans. He has authored over 100 academic articles as well as 8 books, including the landmark text African Religion: The Moral Traditions of Abundant Life. Magesa currently teaches in Nairobi at the Hekima College, Jesuit School of Theology, and in 2014, DePaul recognized him with an honorary doctorate. (Read the news release here.)</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Jan 29, 2016: Vincent and Louise House Info Session at CCM:  LPSC Suite 104	<p>In order to apply to live in the Vincent and Louise House during the 2015-2016 school year, applicants must attend an info session.</p>

<p>The Vincent and Louise House, a year-long residential experience sponsored by Catholic Campus Ministry and supported by the Office of Mission and Values, asks participants to live by the following values: faith, service, social justice, community, and simplicity.</p>

<p>Each year 10 undergraduate DePaul students are selected, via application, to live in the Vincent and Louise House, an intentional Catholic community on DePaul’s Lincoln Park campus. Students living in the house must have a desire to explore faith through a Catholic lens with an emphasis on Vincentian spirituality and must be willing to serve as leaders within the CCM community.   </p>

<p>Members of the house serve dinner to the DePaul community Sunday-Wednesday at 6pm during the Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarters. Please stop by a dinner to meet members of the house and to learn more about the students living in the house. The house is located at 2308 N. Sheffield Ave.</p>

<p>Please contact Katie Sullivan (<a href="mailto:ksulli47@depaul.edu">ksulli47@depaul.edu</a>) with questions.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 3, 2016: Chicago Council on Global Affairs- The Resource Curse and the Role of the West at 81 E Van Buren St, Chicago, IL 60605, USA	<p>The Chicago Council on Global Affairs has generously donated tickets for current Kellstadt Graduate School of Business students to attend their signature events.
<br /> 
<br />REGISTER: If you would like to attend, you will need to create an account/log in via the Chicago Council website and register for the event. At checkout, please use Promotional Code: DEPAUL (in all capital letters) to receive your discounted ticket. 
<br /> 
<br />*Business attire is REQUIRED. For entry to the event, please have your DePaul University ID for easy check-in. </p>

<p>OVERVIEW: </p>

<p>Natural resources empower the world's most coercive regimes. Tyrants, terrorists, and armed groups use resource money to bolster their grip on power. For decades resource-fueled autocrats and extremists have committed human rights violations while Western consumers, paying at the gas station and the mall, inadvertently fund their activities. Leif Wenar argues that America can now lead a peaceful global revolution by finally ending its dependence on authoritarian oil and conflict minerals?making the West more secure at home and better able to solve urgent problems like climate change. Join Leif Wenar and the Council on Global Affairs for a discussion on what role governments, the private sector, and consumers can play in improving the global resource trade.</p>

<p>Leif Wenar?s book, Blood Oil: Tyrants, Violence, and the Rules that Run the World, will be available for purchase and signing from The Book Cellar following the program.</p>

<p>SPEAKER: Leif Wenar is chair of Philosophy and Law at King?s College London. He was a fellow at the Princeton University Center for Human Values, the Australian National University School of Philosophy, The Murphy Institute of Political Economy, and The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs. Wenar has also been a visiting professor in the Princeton Department of Politics, and this spring he will be a William H. Bonsall visiting professor at Stanford.

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 4, 2016: How do I protect that? A mock client interview identifying protectable IP in terms of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets.	<p>Program Highlights
<br /> 
<br />The presentation will address the practical intersections of the various intellectual property regimes. Clients, potential clients, acquaintances, and even family members often have IP law questions related to their products/inventions/businesses, but do not understand the distinctions between each different type of intellectual property. The lawyer's job is to educate and to focus the discussion, identifying pressing issues in separate areas of intellectual property law. The program is designed as a mock client intake interview, illustrating how different IP law issues present themselves in the real world. No CLE credit available.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 4, 2016: Chicago Council on Global Affairs- The Future of Money at 65 W Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604, USA	<p>The Chicago Council on Global Affairs has generously donated tickets for current Kellstadt Graduate School of Business students to attend their signature events.
<br /> 
<br />REGISTER: If you would like to attend, you will need to create an account/log in via the Chicago Council website and register for the event. At checkout, please use Promotional Code: DEPAUL (in all capital letters) to receive your discounted ticket. 
<br /> 
<br />*Business attire is REQUIRED. For entry to the event, please have your DePaul University ID for easy check-in. </p>

<p>OVERVIEW: Today, money is increasingly more bits and bytes rather than bits of paper. Moreover, disruptive financial technologies and innovations?such as cryptocurrencies, mobile payment systems, peer-to-peer lending, and crowdfunding?continue to transform finance as we know it. Bitcoins can render banks superfluous, and new banking forms diminish the ability of central banks to influence the economy through monetary policy. As the nature of money and finance continues to evolve, what are the economic, political, and social implications? Join Tyler Cowen and Randall Kroszner for a conversation on the future of money.</p>

<p>SPEAKER: Tyler Cowen is the Holbert L. Harris Chair of Economics at George Mason University (GMU), where he also serves as chairman and general director of the Mercatus Center. He is coauthor of the blog Marginal Revolution and cofounder of the online educational platform Marginal Revolution University. He writes regularly for publications such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Money, and has authored numerous books?most recently Average is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation. He was named one of the most influential economists of the last decade by The Economist, and in 2011 Foreign Policy named him as one of the "Top 100 Global Thinkers", while Bloomberg BusinessWeek dubbed him "America's Hottest Economist." He holds a BS from GMU and a PhD from Harvard University. </p>

<p>Randall Kroszner is the Norman R. Bobins Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He served as a governor of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 to 2009, taking a leading role in developing responses to the financial crisis. Previously, he was also a member of the President?s Council of Economic Advisers. He currently serves on the advisory board of the Paulson Institute and on the World Economic Forum?s Global Agenda Council on the global financial system. He received the Battle Prize for best corporate finance paper in the Journal of Finance. His recent book with Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, Reforming U.S. Financial Regulation, was on the Washington Post?s political best sellers list. Kroszner provides advice to financial institutions, government organizations, and central banks throughout the world.

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 4, 2016: AFTER MONTAIGNE - The Making of An Anthology at Library - Richardson Library Lincoln Park Campus	<p>Please join the Department of English for a celebration of the essay with the editors and contributors of AFTER MONTAIGNE, who will discuss their experience of creating this groundbreaking new anthology, Thursday, February 4th at 6 p.m. in Richardson 115. </p>

<p>Though it’s been over four hundred years since he began writing his essays, Montaigne’s writing is still fresh, and his use of the form as a means of self-exploration in the world around him reads as innovative—even by modern standards. He is, simply put, the writer to whom all essayists are indebted. Each contributor has chosen one of Montaigne’s 107 essays and has written his/her own essay of the same title and on the same theme, using a quote from Montaigne’s essay as an epigraph. The overall effect is akin to a covers album, with each writer offering his or her own interpretation and stylistic verve to Montaigne’s themes in ways that both reinforce and challenge the French writer’s prose, ideas, and forms.</p>

<p>"Though Montaigne wrote more than 400 years ago, he feels ageless to these writers, who celebrate his 'drily mellifluous voice,' discursive style, and relentless curiosity. With flair, wit, and imagination, these writers embrace and often challenge their mentor, with results that will inspire readers to also seek out the originals."

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 8, 2016: Arts Law Colloquium: The Legal Lives of Levantine Artifacts at Lewis Center	<p>Join DePaul's Center for Art, Museum & Cultural Heritage Law and Center for Intellectual Property Law & Information Technology on Monday, February 8th for a special lecture on the looting and trafficking of antiquities from the Eastern Mediterranean. </p>

<p>Law plays an important role in the social lives of artifacts. For the last decade or more the legal lives of high-profile Levantine artifacts have been front-page news, focusing on particular artifacts like the Persepolis archives, the James Ossuary, the Mesha Stele, and the Dead Sea Scrolls, but laws concerning cultural heritage also affect more prosaic items, everyday items purchased and esteemed by visitors to the region. The colonial legal relics of the Ottoman Empire and the British Mandate period are enshrined in current laws in Israel, Palestine, and Jordan. In this presentation, Dr. Morag Kersel, Professor of Anthropology at DePaul University and CAMCHL's affiliated faculty member, will examine how these historical inheritances and current practices influence the social lives of Levantine artifacts.</p>

<p>Light refreshments will be served. There is no charge to attend but if you wish to attend, you must register in advance.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 16, 2016: Buddhism and Politics: Mindful Social Engagement During an Election Year at DePaul Theater School Lobby	<p>Date: Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2016</p>

<p>Location: Theater School Lobby </p>

<p>Title: Buddhism and Politics: Mindful Social Engagement During an Election Year</p>

<p>Descriptions: Another election year has begun.  Already the 24/7 news cycles have been filled with angry and hateful speech.  How can we approach our responsibilities as citizens without becoming angry or cynical ourselves?  Two Buddhist teachers will discuss how some basic spiritual practices can help us remain thoughtful, composed and committed.
<br />Speakers: Taigen Dan Leighton & Jack Lawlor </p>

<p>Taigen is a long-time social justice activist, and also author or translator of numerous Buddhist studies books, including Faces of Compassion: Classic Bodhisattva Archetypes. He teaches online at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, where he received a PhD.</p>

<p>Jack Lawlor was ordained a Dharma Teacher by Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh in 1992.  He has served as President of the Buddhist Council of the Midwest, on the national board of directors of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, and on the Care-Taking Council of the North American Dharma Teachers Sangha in Thich Nhat Hanh's tradition.  He is also a co-founder of Lakeside Buddha Sangha in Evanston, Illinois."</p>

<p>Light refreshments will be served.

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 18, 2016: Masterclass with violinist Kevork Mardirossian at Recital Hall	<p>DePaul School of Music is pleased to welcome Kevork Mardirossian to campus for a masterclass on Thursday, Feb 18. </p>

<p>While participation in the masterclass is limited to select students, all are welcome to attend.</p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>Kevork Mardirossian is James H. Rudy Professor of Violin at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he was appointed in 2008.</p>

<p>His first solo recital was at age 12, and his intensive concert career started when he won the gold medal and first prize at the Obretenov Violin Competition in Bulgaria in 1978, the Gold medal at Katya Popova International Music Festival in 1979, and several international chamber music competitions in 1985-86 with his duo partner, pianist Lee Phillips.  </p>

<p>Mardirossian performed as concert soloist, recitalist, and chamber musician throughout Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe before moving to Europe, where he developed an impressive solo career, with tours of England, Wales, Italy, France, and the United States, including debuts in London and Carnegie Hall in 1992. He has appeared as guest artist at international music festivals such as Manuel De Falla in Spain; Shanghai festival in China; in Cheltenham, England; European Cultural Months; International Chamber Music Festival in Plovdiv, Bulgaria; Czech Festival in Trento, Italy; and Sofia Musical Weeks, among others in France, Germany, Spain, Japan, China, and Korea.</p>

<p>His education and training are from the Dobrin Petkov Music School in Bulgaria, Bulgarian State Conservatory, Maison de la Culture in Brussels, and Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he was awarded the Concert Artist (Premier Prix) award.</p>

<p>Mardirossian's teachers and mentors were Elena Doikova, Anton H. Atanasov, Vladimir Avramov, Artur Grumiaux, Janos Starker, and Yfrah Neaman.</p>

<p>In 1980, he became the concertmaster of the Plovdiv Philharmonic until 1988, when he moved to the United States, where he was appointed artist-in-residence at the University of Central Arkansas. There he co-founded the Kapelle Trio with pianist Lee Phillips and cellist Felice Farrell as well as the Heber Springs Chamber Music Festival and master courses in 1998. From 1995 to 2008, he was violin professor and chair of the String Department at the College of Music and Drama at Louisiana State University (LSU).</p>

<p>Mardirossian has established himself as a highly respected violin pedagogue and devoted mentor to more than 100 outstanding students, many of them winners in numerous national and international competitions. Others can be found in the world’s leading orchestras as concertmasters and principals, and as teachers in universities in the United States, Europe, and Asia.</p>

<p>Mardirossian is a British Council scholar and recipient of the Indiana University James H. Rudy faculty award, LSU Distinguished Faculty Award, and LSU School of Music Award for Excellence in Teaching, as well as the Galante Professorship and the San Diego II Alumni Professorship of Honor.</p>

<p>He is on the jury of several international violin competitions, such as the Henrik Szheryng International Violin competition in Mexico, Vladigerov International Competition in Bulgaria, Beethoven Violin Competition in the Czech Republic, and Shanghai International Violin Competition, among others.</p>

<p>He has served on the faculties of the International Institute at Round Top, Texas (2001-08); Aria String Academy in Massachusetts; Aurora Chamber Music festival in Sweden; Manuel De Falla International Courses in Granada, Spain; String Academy in Pontedeume, Spain; and international master courses at the Shanghai Conservatory.

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 22, 2016: Making in Chicago at DePaul Art Museum	<p>Chicago is often described as the most American of cities and in his book The Third Coast Thomas Dyja writes that to understand America we must understand the legacies of Chicago-made culture. How then do we understand the contribution of artists working in Chicago now? Are we Chicago artists or just artists who happen to live and work here? Is Chicago our identity, our mission, one of our traditions, or merely an accident of time and place? This multidisciplinary panel of artists who teach at Chicago's DePaul University attempt to answer the question: what does it mean to be a maker of art in Chicago today?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>OVERVIEW: Bookended by the falling of the Berlin Wall and the Twin Towers, the 1990s may appear to have been a peaceful and prosperous decade for America. But closer inspection reveals a fraught period for the nation?s politics, according to Gil Troy. Domestically this was an era of rising extremism and violence, including the Oklahoma City bombing and Waco Siege. Further afield, America wrestled with whether to intervene to halt genocides in Africa and the Balkans. Meanwhile, the clash of a liberal president and a resurgent conservative movement fostered an increasingly partisan political climate. At the center of the storm was the Baby Boomer president, Bill Clinton, whose vision, energy, and indiscretions would dominate the decade. What is the political legacy of the turbulent 90s, and how might it impact the prospects for another Clinton presidency?</p>

<p>Gil Troy?s new Book The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s will be available for sale and signing after the program from The Book Cellar.</p>

<p>SPEAKER: Gil Troy is a presidential historian and professor of history at McGill University. Troy has authored ten books on the American presidency and has written biographies of Ronald Reagan and Hillary Clinton. He is a frequent commentator on politics and culture and his writing has appeared in The New York Times, the New Republic, and The Washington Post.

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 23, 2016: Chicago Council on Global Affairs- Europe: What Next? at 140 E Walton Pl, Chicago, IL 60611, USA	<p>The Chicago Council on Global Affairs has generously donated tickets for current Kellstadt Graduate School of Business students to attend their signature events.
<br /> 
<br />REGISTER: If you would like to attend, you will need to create an account/log in via the Chicago Council website and register for the event. At checkout, please use Promotional Code: DEPAUL (in all capital letters) to receive your discounted ticket. 
<br /> 
<br />*Business attire is REQUIRED. For entry to the event, please have your DePaul University ID for easy check-in. </p>

<p>OVERVIEW: Europe is still facing a complex environment. The economic recovery is slowing, despite an ongoing European Central Bank stimulus package and low energy prices?and the euro zone is still a monetary but not a fiscal union. The internal dynamics of the European Union are also strained by increased security concerns, the migrant crisis, and rising populism, among other factors. Moreover, the integration of the continent?s economies and societies seems to have halted?as exemplified by the new border fences being constructed by various countries. Will Europe emerge stronger or weaker from these trials? Please join The Chicago Council and Luigi Zingales for a discussion on the future of Europe.   </p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 24, 2016: Best Practices for Collaborative Teaching (Lincoln Park) at Richardson Library, Room 300	<p>Collaboratively taught courses can be a catalyst for creative problem solving, integrative learning, and trans-disciplinary inquiry among both the students and faculty who take part in the experience. However, along with these benefits come new logistical and pedagogical challenges for faculty. This interactive workshop will introduce you to resources and best practices for collaborative teaching. The workshop facilitator will share examples of successful collaboratively taught courses as well as strategies for partnering with collaborators, designing courses, and maximizing the learning experience for students while avoiding common pitfalls.
<br />This workshop will be useful to individuals considering collaborative teaching, those who have recently begun teaching collaboratively, as well as those with years of experience. Please bring an existing syllabus or an idea for a collaborative course that you would like to flesh out.
<br />After participating in this workshop, you will be able to:</p>

<p>Compare models of collaborative teaching
<br />Identify strategies and resources for finding a collaborative teaching partner
<br />Apply best practices for designing and facilitating a collaboratively taughtcourse</p>

<p>Facilitated by guest speaker Dr. Cory Christopher. Cory is the Director of UC Forward, a trans-disciplinary program at the University of Cincinnati that pairs students, faculty, and outside stakeholders from different fields and varying perspectives to develop innovative solutions to today's real world problems. In his role as director, he facilitates a course redesign workshop for faculty who want to teach collaboratively. Cory earned his BS and MS degrees in Ecology from the School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, and his PhD in Biology from the University of Cincinnati. Before joining UC Forward, he led Miami University of Ohio's Advanced Inquiry Program, a collaborative masters degree program through the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. This program focused on helping K-12 teachers and community educators develop inquiry-based and experiential learning curriculums for both formal classrooms and public education initiatives. His respect for teamwork and his systems-based view of the world drive Cory to be a matchmaker for faculty, students, and community partners from different backgrounds.
<br />This workshop is cosponsored by DePaul's Innovation Through Collaboration Initiative and the Office for Teaching, Learning & Assessment. Light refreshments will be served.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 24, 2016: Best Practices for Collaborative Teaching (Loop) at DePaul Center Concourse Area, Room C101	<p>Collaboratively taught courses can be a catalyst for creative problem solving, integrative learning, and trans-disciplinary inquiry among both the students and faculty who take part in the experience. However, along with these benefits come new logistical and pedagogical challenges for faculty. This interactive workshop will introduce you to resources and best practices for collaborative teaching. The workshop facilitator will share examples of successful collaboratively taught courses as well as strategies for partnering with collaborators, designing courses, and maximizing the learning experience for students while avoiding common pitfalls.
<br />This workshop will be useful to individuals considering collaborative teaching, those who have recently begun teaching collaboratively, as well as those with years of experience. Please bring an existing syllabus or an idea for a collaborative course that you would like to flesh out.
<br />After participating in this workshop, you will be able to:</p>

<p>Compare models of collaborative teaching
<br />Identify strategies and resources for finding a collaborative teaching partner
<br />Apply best practices for designing and facilitating a collaboratively taughtcourse</p>

<p>Facilitated by guest speaker Dr. Cory Christopher. Cory is the Director of UC Forward, a trans-disciplinary program at the University of Cincinnati that pairs students, faculty, and outside stakeholders from different fields and varying perspectives to develop innovative solutions to today's real world problems. In his role as director, he facilitates a course redesign workshop for faculty who want to teach collaboratively. Cory earned his BS and MS degrees in Ecology from the School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, and his PhD in Biology from the University of Cincinnati. Before joining UC Forward, he led Miami University of Ohio's Advanced Inquiry Program, a collaborative masters degree program through the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. This program focused on helping K-12 teachers and community educators develop inquiry-based and experiential learning curriculums for both formal classrooms and public education initiatives. His respect for teamwork and his systems-based view of the world drive Cory to be a matchmaker for faculty, students, and community partners from different backgrounds.
<br />This workshop is cosponsored by DePaul's Innovation Through Collaboration Initiative and the Office for Teaching, Learning & Assessment. Light refreshments will be served.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 24, 2016: Semiotics and the Study of Jewish Culture in Late Antiquity at Cortelyou Commons	<p>Host: Alexei Sivertsev
<br />Description: Scholars have increasingly turned to the category of semiotics to construct their narratives of late antiquity. In the words of Thomas Sizgorich, a lexicon of signs, symbols, narratives, and associations constituted a semiotic brew in late antiquity that united diverse communities otherwise separated by language, culture, and dogma across a geographical expanse stretching from Ireland to Yemen. This panel sets out to discuss the implications of a semiotic study of late antiquity for our interpretation of Jewish art and literature produced between the third and the eighth centuries of the Common Era.</p>

<p>Speakers: Mira Balberg & Ra'anan Boustan</p>

<p>Mira Balberg:  </p>

<p>Mira Balberg is assistant professor of Religious Studies at Northwestern University. She is the author of Purity, Body, and Self in Early Rabbinic Literature (University of California Press, 2014) and of Gateway to Rabbinic Literature (פתח לספרות חז"ל) (The Open University of Israel Press, 2013). Other topics on which she has published include questions of personhood in rabbinic literature, the human body and its changing cultural meanings in ancient Jewish texts, and the production of knowledge in late antiquity.  She is currently working on a book exploring the transformation of sacrifice in early rabbinic literature. ​</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ra'anan Boustan:  </p>

<p>Ra‘anan Boustan is an Associate Professor in the Department of History at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research and teaching explore the dynamic intersections between Judaism and other Mediterranean religious traditions. He is the author of From Martyr to Mystic: Rabbinic Martyrology and the Making of Merkavah Mysticism (2005), has published widely in leading journals such as Harvard Theological Review, The Jewish Quarterly Review, Jewish Studies Quarterly, and Medieval Encounters, and has co-edited eight volumes, most recently a special issue of the journal Archiv für Religionsgeschichte on “Authoritative Traditions and Ritual Power in the Ancient World” (2015).</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Feb 25, 2016: Semiotics and the Study of Jewish Culture in Late Antiquity at Cortelyou Commons	<p>Host: Alexei Sivertsev
<br />Description: Scholars have increasingly turned to the category of semiotics to construct their narratives of late antiquity. In the words of Thomas Sizgorich, a lexicon of signs, symbols, narratives, and associations constituted a semiotic brew in late antiquity that united diverse communities otherwise separated by language, culture, and dogma across a geographical expanse stretching from Ireland to Yemen. This panel sets out to discuss the implications of a semiotic study of late antiquity for our interpretation of Jewish art and literature produced between the third and the eighth centuries of the Common Era.</p>

<p>Speakers: Mira Balberg & Ra'anan Boustan</p>

<p>Mira Balberg:  </p>

<p>Mira Balberg is assistant professor of Religious Studies at Northwestern University. She is the author of Purity, Body, and Self in Early Rabbinic Literature (University of California Press, 2014) and of Gateway to Rabbinic Literature (פתח לספרות חז"ל) (The Open University of Israel Press, 2013). Other topics on which she has published include questions of personhood in rabbinic literature, the human body and its changing cultural meanings in ancient Jewish texts, and the production of knowledge in late antiquity.  She is currently working on a book exploring the transformation of sacrifice in early rabbinic literature. ​</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ra'anan Boustan:  </p>

<p>Ra‘anan Boustan is an Associate Professor in the Department of History at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research and teaching explore the dynamic intersections between Judaism and other Mediterranean religious traditions. He is the author of From Martyr to Mystic: Rabbinic Martyrology and the Making of Merkavah Mysticism (2005), has published widely in leading journals such as Harvard Theological Review, The Jewish Quarterly Review, Jewish Studies Quarterly, and Medieval Encounters, and has co-edited eight volumes, most recently a special issue of the journal Archiv für Religionsgeschichte on “Authoritative Traditions and Ritual Power in the Ancient World” (2015).</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Mar 1, 2016: DeAndreis-Rosati Memorial Archives (DRMA) Lecture at Library - Richardson Library Lincoln Park Campus	<p>Lecturer: Thérèse Peeters</p>

<p>Title: The role of trust in the Vincentian Missions in North Africa (1645-1689)</p>

<p>Short description of the lecture:</p>

<p>My research into the correspondence of seventeenth century Vincentian missionaries on the Barbary Coast (1645-1689) has revealed an aspect of the Catholic missions that has not yet been thoroughly  considered: the role of trust in the success or failure of these missions. Being confronted with a hostile Muslim environment, the dreadful situation of the slaves, and with the greatest enemy of all, the plague, the Vincentian Missionaries needed to be in a good relationship with Vincent de Paul, the superior general in Paris, and with the cardinals of  Propaganda Fide in Rome. As is apparent from the two case studies that I will present, this initial trust was continuously reconsidered both by De Paul and Propaganda Fide. Historians have recently shown that early modern people consciously thought about whom to trust, and that trust and trustworthiness are realities that can be studied historically. I argue that it can also be a valuable lens through which to reach a better understanding of early modern Catholic missions: the extensive correspondence between the founder of the Congregation of the Mission and his followers overseas, is a rich treasure from which to learn about this poorly considered aspect of the missionary world of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A brief biography</p>

<p>In 2012, Thérèse Peeters completed her BA in Italian language and culture, and her BA in history at Leiden University. During her master Medieval and early modern European history at the same university, she specialized on missionary correspondence and the role of trust. She also collaborated at the project “Vincent de Paul, the Congregation of the Mission, and the Papacy: Documents from the Vatican Archives (1625-1670),” a digital catalogue of archival sources and a digital edition of selected documents. She is currently working on her PhD project, entitled: “Trust in the Counter-Reformation”.</p>

<br /> 
<br />         The latest info on the Patent Office Exam,

<br />         How it works, now that it's on computer and “on demand,”

<br />         How the America Invents Act is impacting the Exam, and
<br />         Recommendations on when and how to study for this very difficult Exam.
<br /> 
<br />Scholarships to PLI's other IP programs will also be discussed.

DePaul Univerbsity	Mar 2, 2016: Chicago Council on Global Affairs-  American Intelligence in the Age of Terror at Tbd, Neillsville, WI 54456, USA	<p>The Chicago Council on Global Affairs has generously donated tickets for current Kellstadt Graduate School of Business students to attend their signature events.
<br /> 
<br />REGISTER: If you would like to attend, you will need to create an account/log in via the Chicago Council website and register for the event. At checkout, please use Promotional Code: DEPAUL (in all capital letters) to receive your discounted ticket.

<br />*Business attire is REQUIRED. For entry to the event, please have your DePaul University ID for easy check-in. </p>

<p>OVERVIEW:The US intelligence establishment has appeared increasingly beleaguered and isolated in recent years. Outwardly the CIA and NSA today must confront a bewildering array of adversaries ? hostile nations, global jihadists, and cyber saboteurs ? all emboldened by new technologies. Meanwhile, closer to home, controversies relating to the techniques employed by America?s intelligence agencies in the war on terror have resulted in heightened public criticism and scrutiny of their work. And with the Edward Snowden leaks, the agencies have even appeared vulnerable from within. How have the pressures of the turbulent years since 9/11 impacted the intelligence community?s ability to protect the nation? And how might America?s civilian, military, and intelligence leaders attempt to rebalance security and civil liberties in the coming years?</p>

<p>General Michael V. Hayden?s new book, Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, will be available for purchase and signing from The Book Cellar after the program.</p>

<p>SPEAKER: Michael V. Hayden is a retired US Air Force four-star general and served as director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005, as principal director of National Intelligence from 2005 to 2006, and as director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006-2009. Previously he also held the posts of commander of the Air Intelligence Agency, and as director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center. Hayden is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy, and serves as a distinguished visiting fellow at George Mason University School of Public Policy. Hayden holds a BA and MA from Duquesne University. </p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Mar 7, 2016: Hungry Hungry Humanities: Eating is Understanding at DePaul Student Center	<p>Scholars throughout history have dismissed food and drink as topics that are, at best, unworthy of sustained attention, and at worst, distractions from clear thinking and even from the well-being of the mind. In a special multi-sensory, interactive foodie event, philosopher Robert Valgenti (Lebanon Valley College) will explore phenomena such as deliciousness, disgust, and authenticity in order to ask: Can food uncover something profound about humans and the ways that they understand their world? Can the aroma of fresh ideas rouse thinking from its gastronomic slumber?</p>

<p>The first 100 attendees will receive a bento box packed with food: a mini three-course meal that will be used throughout the presentation as audience members are asked to eat together and understand together.</p>

<p>Discounted parking rate available. See Humanities Center staff at event for details.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Mar 8, 2016: An Evening with Aja Monet at Student Center (Lincoln Park)	<p>An internationally established poet, singer, performer, and educator, Monet’s craft is an in-depth reflection of emotional wisdom, skill, and activism. The youngest individual to win the legendary Nuyorican Poet’s Café Grand Slam title, she is recognized for combining her spellbound voice and powerful imagery on stage. Her books of poetry are Inner-City Chants & Cyborg Cyphers, (2015) and The Black Unicorn Sings (Penmanship books). In addition, she collaborated with poet/musician Saul Williams on the book Chorus: a literary mixtape (MTV books/Simon & Schuster). Her first CD, Scared to Make Love/Scared Not To, a testament to her creative lens and a social commentary on the discussion of love, was independently released through Bandcamp. Of Cuban-Jamaican heritage, Monet has performed at world-renowned venues including the Town Hall Theater, the Apollo Theater, the United Nations in New York City, and the NAACP’s Barack Obama Inaugural event in Washington DC.</p>

DePaul Univerbsity	Mar 11, 2016: DePaul Opera Theatre presents Strauss' Die Fledermaus at Merle Reskin Theatre	<p>Laughter, waltz and light-hearted fun await you at DePaul Opera Theatre’s production of the hilarious and extraordinary musical romp, Die Fledermaus.</p>

<p>Johann Strauss’ classic Viennese operetta is a mixture of comedy and colorful characters. Spend a riotous evening in the company of Gabriel von Eisenstein, his beautiful wife Rosalinda, her besotted lover Alfred, the pert and saucy parlor-maid Adele, and the wily Doctor Falke, as they confuse and amuse themselves and us in a sophisticated hide-and-seek game of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>Sung in English, this production features a full orchestra and chorus, glamorous costumes and, of course, champagne! Join conductor Steven Mosteller, director Harry Silverstein, and the students of DePaul Opera Theatre at what is sure to be a truly splendid party.
<br /> </p>

<p>Die Fledermaus will be performed at the Merle Reskin Theatre, 60 E Balbo Drive, Chicago.</p>

<p>Tickets go on sale, Tuesday, January 19 at noon!</p>
