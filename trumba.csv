Tufts Univerbsity	MLK Annual University Celebration: Moving the Movement Forward	Jan 26, 2016, 4:30pm&nbsp;EST <br/><br/>Annual MLK University Celebration: Moving the Movement Forward<br /> <br /> Each year, Tufts University hosts an annual celebration honoring the life of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The recent increase in student protest at college campuses across the country has led to a nationwide conversation that challenges our sense of awareness and compels us to reflect on Dr. King&#8217;s concern for racial justice and equality.<br /> <br /> For this year&#8217;s celebration, we will examine the roots of today&#8217;s activism through the lens of Dr. King and his contemporaries. We will put their voices in conversation with modern scholars and student activists to reflect on how today&#8217;s generation is moving the movement forward. How have the leaders of the past influenced the student activism of today? Students will reflect on some of the key concerns of Dr. King&#8217;s legacy, including faith, equality, unity/collective healing, justice, and action.<br /> <br /> For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:Africana@tufts.edu" target="_blank">Africana@tufts.edu</a>. <br/><br/><b>Building</b>:&nbsp;<a onmouseout="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOut(event, this)" objectid="193609" url.objectid="193609" spudname="objectpopup" spudposition="1" onmouseover="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOver(event, this)" spudwidth="400" url.objecttype="19594" href="javascript:Nav(&#39;objectid=193609&amp;objecttype=19594&amp;view=object&amp;-childview=&amp;-index=&#39;,&#39;detailBase&#39;)">Goddard Chapel</a> <br/><b>Campus</b>:&nbsp;Medford/Somerville Campus <br/><b>City</b>:&nbsp;Medford, MA 02155 <br/><b>Category</b>:&nbsp;Diversity, Religious and Spiritual Life, Special Events <br/><b>School</b>:&nbsp;University-wide <br/><b>Event Contact</b>:&nbsp;Zachary Cole,  Program and Outreach Specialist,  University Chaplaincy,  Tufts University,  Goddard Chapel,  3 The Green,  Medford, MA 02155,  617.627.0532 <br/><b>Event Sponsor</b>:&nbsp;Sponsored by the Office of the President, the Office of the Chief Diversity Officer, the Africana Center, the University Chaplaincy, the Jonathan M.

Tufts Univerbsity	EPIIC 2016 Film Series presents La Haine	Jan 26, 2016, 7:30pm&nbsp;EST <br/><br/>Mathieu Kassovitz took the film world by storm with La Haine, a gritty, unsettling, and visually explosive look at the racial and cultural volatility in modern-day France, specifically the low-income banlieue districts on Paris&#8217;s outskirts. Aimlessly passing their days in the concrete environs of their dead-end suburbia, Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Hubert (Hubert Kound&#233;), and Sa&#239;d (Sa&#239;d Taghmaoui)&#8212;a Jew, an African, and an Arab&#8212;give human faces to France&#8217;s immigrant populations, their bristling resentment at their marginalization slowly simmering until it reaches a climactic boiling point.<br /> <br /> A work of tough beauty, La Haine is a landmark of contemporary French cinema and a gripping reflection of its country&#8217;s ongoing identity crisis.<br /> <br /> With guest speaker: Ariane Chebel d&#8217;Appollonia<br /> <br /> A Professor at the School of Public Affairs and Administration at Rutgers, she is also Senior Researcher affiliated with Sciences Po Paris. Her research focuses on the politics of immigration and anti-discrimination, security issues, racism and xenophobia, extreme-right wing movements, immigrant integration, urban racism, and European policies. Her recent publications include Les Fronti&#232;res du Racisme, Frontiers of Fears: Immigration and Insecurity in the United States and Europe and Migrant Mobilization and Securitization in the US and Europe: How Does it Feel to Be a Threat?.

Tufts Univerbsity	ENVS Lunch & Learn: X Marks the Spot - Science in the Central Pacific	Feb 11, 2016, 12pm&nbsp;EST <br/><br/>The 2015-16 El Nino is strongest in the Central Pacific, near where the equator meets the international dateline. The closest coral reefs to this region are the Phoenix Islands, which together are owned by Kiribati and comprise the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, which is the largest and deepest UNESCO World Heritage Site on the planet. Expeditions to this remote region are providing insight into the impact and resilience of El Nino, with implications for regions that face the double jeapordy of both climate change and local human impact. Natural laboratories like the Phoenix Islands are critical benchmarks to decouple the impacts of global, versus local, influences. <br/><br/><b>Building</b>:&nbsp;<a onmouseout="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOut(event, this)" objectid="193495" url.objectid="193495" spudname="objectpopup" spudposition="1" onmouseover="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOver(event, this)" spudwidth="400" url.objecttype="19594" href="javascript:Nav(&#39;objectid=193495&amp;objecttype=19594&amp;view=object&amp;-childview=&amp;-index=&#39;,&#39;detailBase&#39;)">Lincoln Filene Center</a> <br/><b>Campus</b>:&nbsp;Medford/Somerville Campus <br/><b>City</b>:&nbsp;Medford, MA 02155 <br/><b>Location Details</b>:&nbsp;Rabb Room <br/><b>Category</b>:&nbsp;Lectures &amp; Seminars <br/><b>Event Contact</b>:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sara.gomez@tufts.edu" target="_blank">sara.gomez@tufts.edu</a> <br/><b>More info</b>:&nbsp;<a href="http://as.tufts.edu/environmentalStudies/lunch/" target="_blank" title="http://as.tufts.edu/environmentalStudies/lunch/">as.tufts.edu&#8230;</a> <br/><br/>	11 Feb 2016 17:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/norris-and-margery-bendetson-epiic-international-symposium

Meyer at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, and Meyer later at a rally in Argentina, where he lived and was a human rights activist during that country&#39;s &quot;Dirty War&quot; and after. <br/><br/><b>Building</b>:&nbsp;<a onmouseout="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOut(event, this)" objectid="193484" url.objectid="193484" spudname="objectpopup" spudposition="1" onmouseover="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOver(event, this)" spudwidth="400" url.objecttype="19594" href="javascript:Nav(&#39;objectid=193484&amp;objecttype=19594&amp;view=object&amp;-childview=&amp;-index=&#39;,&#39;detailBase&#39;)">Aidekman Arts Center</a> <br/><b>Campus</b>:&nbsp;Medford/Somerville Campus <br/><b>City</b>:&nbsp;Medford, MA 02155 <br/><b>Location Details</b>:&nbsp;Tufts University Art Gallery,  @ The Aidekman Arts Center,  40 Talbot Ave. Medford, MA 02155,  t: (617) 627-3518,  <a href="http://artgallery.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">artgallery.tufts.edu</a> <br/><b>Category</b>:&nbsp;Arts &amp; Culture, Diversity, Lectures &amp; Seminars, Special Events <br/><b>School</b>:&nbsp;Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, Gerald J. and Dorothy R.

Tufts Univerbsity	ENVS Lunch & Learn: Sustainable Aquaculture	Mar 31, 2016, 12pm&nbsp;EDT <br/><br/>Seaweed aquaculture is a growing field of interest worldwide and in the Northeast United States. Concerns over declining wild fisheries and the environmental impacts of intensive fish aquaculture have lead researchers to look into extractive crops (e.g. seaweed and shellfish) that can be grown in unison with fish. In these systems, known as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems, the nutrients required for the growth of the extractive crop are provided by the effluent of the fed crop (e.g. fish). This talk examines the aquaculture industry, why seaweeds are good candidates for aquaculture, research conducted to develop seaweeds as potential crops in New England, and the current status of the New England seaweed aquaculture industry. <br/><br/><b>Building</b>:&nbsp;<a onmouseout="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOut(event, this)" objectid="193495" url.objectid="193495" spudname="objectpopup" spudposition="1" onmouseover="Trumba.Spuds.popupOnMouseOver(event, this)" spudwidth="400" url.objecttype="19594" href="javascript:Nav(&#39;objectid=193495&amp;objecttype=19594&amp;view=object&amp;-childview=&amp;-index=&#39;,&#39;detailBase&#39;)">Lincoln Filene Center</a> <br/><b>Campus</b>:&nbsp;Medford/Somerville Campus <br/><b>City</b>:&nbsp;Medford, MA 02155 <br/><b>Location Details</b>:&nbsp;Rabb Room <br/><b>Category</b>:&nbsp;Lectures &amp; Seminars <br/><b>Event Contact</b>:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sara.gomez@tufts.edu" target="_blank">sara.gomez@tufts.edu</a> <br/><b>More info</b>:&nbsp;<a href="http://as.tufts.edu/environmentalStudies/lunch/" target="_blank" title="http://as.tufts.edu/environmentalStudies/lunch/">as.tufts.edu&#8230;</a> <br/><br/>	31 Mar 2016 16:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	Link unavailable
