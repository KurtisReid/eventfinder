UT	Jan 23, 2016: Exhibition: Strange Pilgrims at Visual Arts Center, Art Building (ART)	<p>Strange Pilgrims is an exhibition organized by The Contemporary Austin and spans multiple venues that include the museum's Jones Center and Laguna Gloria locations in addition to the Visual Arts Center.</p>

<p>The exhibition begins with the metaphorical notion of the traveler: an open-ended journey through strange and unfamiliar spaces, embarking on a pilgrimage not only in time and place but also through imagination, the senses, and perception. Strange Pilgrims brings together a collection of experiential-based ideas and projects proposing unconventional gestures and formats, defining “experiential art” as work that is immersive, participatory, performative, or kinetic, and favoring art from the vantage point of the phenomenological experience. Taking its title from a collection of twelve short stories of the same name by the writer Gabriel García Márquez, Strange Pilgrims is The Contemporary Austin’s first large-scale, thematic group exhibition.</p>

<p>Strange Pilgrims includes work by artists: Charles Atlas, Trisha Baga, Millie Chen, Phil Collins, Andy Coolquitt, Ayşe Erkmen, Roger Hiorns, Nancy Holt, Lakes Were Rivers, Angelbert Metoyer, Bruce Nauman, Yoko Ono, Paul Sharits, and Sofía Táboas.</p>

<p>Strange Pilgrims is organized by Heather Pesanti, Senior Curator, The Contemporary Austin, with text also by Pesanti.</p>

UT	Jan 23, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibitions program is supported in part by the Lester Robbins and Sheila Johnson Robbins Traveling and Special Exhibition Fund established in 1990. The traveling exhibitions are also supported by Dr. and Mrs. Sol Center.</p>

Loren Winship Drama Building (WIN)	<p>For five days in January, three writers, Martín Zimmerman, Kirk Lynn, and Joanna Garner, will work to develop their current passion projects during the groundswell playwriting conference. This new play conference offers the time, space, and collaborators with which to dig in and explore a piece in process. Their week of work culminates in a marathon day of readings and conversation on Saturday, January 23, 2016.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>By holding space for one current University of Texas MFA playwriting student, one UT faculty member, and one alum of the MFA program, the conference celebrates the unique voices found and forged at UT, showing how what starts here really is changing the world. Presented in collaboration with the UT Department of Theatre and Dance, this is the inaugural year of the groundswell playwrights conference.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In addition to our featured playwrights, we're inviting all Longhorns and the people who love them to attend our final marathon day of readings on January 23rd. Whether you attended UT Austin, have been made to feel at home as a guest artist, are part of the larger Austin community, or are a member of the national theater world curious about the cutting-edge work going on here, this conference is designed to make you feel at home. We aim to build on our shared vocabulary as theatre makers, supporting the work in a nurturing, challenging environment that reflects the values of the UT MFA programs.</p>

UT	Jan 23, 2016: Wild Kratts Live - Evening at Bass Concert Hall, Performing Arts Center (PAC)	<p>Animated Kratt Brothers, Martin and Chris, “come to real life” in a classically Wild Kratts story. Off “To the Creature Rescue!” the Emmy nominated Kratt Brothers activate some fan favorite Creature Power Suits to confront a comic villain. Through hilarious pratfalls and amazing animal ‘wow facts’ the Wild Kratts team rescues their favorite invention from Zach’s clutches so the animals of the creature world are safe once again.</p>

<p>Wild Kratts LIVE! is created for the stage by the imaginative minds of Martin Kratt and Chris Kratt from Zooboomafoo, Kratt’s Creatures and Be the Creature. The Kratt Brothers’ national tours draw tens of thousands of creature-crazy kids and their families and the not-for-profit Kratt Brothers Creature Hero Society, together with kids, has successfully protected critical wildlife habitats through the creation of nature reserves.</p>

UT	Jan 24, 2016: Exhibition: Strange Pilgrims at Visual Arts Center, Art Building (ART)	<p>Strange Pilgrims is an exhibition organized by The Contemporary Austin and spans multiple venues that include the museum's Jones Center and Laguna Gloria locations in addition to the Visual Arts Center.</p>

<p>The exhibition begins with the metaphorical notion of the traveler: an open-ended journey through strange and unfamiliar spaces, embarking on a pilgrimage not only in time and place but also through imagination, the senses, and perception. Strange Pilgrims brings together a collection of experiential-based ideas and projects proposing unconventional gestures and formats, defining “experiential art” as work that is immersive, participatory, performative, or kinetic, and favoring art from the vantage point of the phenomenological experience. Taking its title from a collection of twelve short stories of the same name by the writer Gabriel García Márquez, Strange Pilgrims is The Contemporary Austin’s first large-scale, thematic group exhibition.</p>

<p>Strange Pilgrims includes work by artists: Charles Atlas, Trisha Baga, Millie Chen, Phil Collins, Andy Coolquitt, Ayşe Erkmen, Roger Hiorns, Nancy Holt, Lakes Were Rivers, Angelbert Metoyer, Bruce Nauman, Yoko Ono, Paul Sharits, and Sofía Táboas.</p>

<p>Strange Pilgrims is organized by Heather Pesanti, Senior Curator, The Contemporary Austin, with text also by Pesanti.</p>

<p>Special venue support and artist-in-residence partnership has been provided through the Visual Arts Center in the Department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>

<p>Hours vary by location. Visit thecontemporaryaustin.org for details.</p>

UT	Jan 24, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibitions program is supported in part by the Lester Robbins and Sheila Johnson Robbins Traveling and Special Exhibition Fund established in 1990. The traveling exhibitions are also supported by Dr. and Mrs. Sol Center.</p>

UT	Jan 25, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibitions program is supported in part by the Lester Robbins and Sheila Johnson Robbins Traveling and Special Exhibition Fund established in 1990. The traveling exhibitions are also supported by Dr. and Mrs. Sol Center.</p>

UT	Jan 26, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

UT	Jan 26, 2016: Texas Tai Chi at Student Activity Center (SAC) dance room (2.310)	<p>This is a staff interest group — all are welcome: faculty, staff, and students.
<br />No experience is necessary and all levels are welcome. This class will introduce qi gong (breathing), taiji walking exercise, and movements from the Yang-style 24-step form. Be comfortable — wear clothes you can move in. Keep in mind tai chi builds your body awareness because it asks you to consciously move your eyes, hands, arms, waist, and legs all at once — no easy task! Don’t let yourself get frustrated, just try to get a hang of what you can.
<br />There is no set curriculum for the classes, instead it is ongoing practice and learning.  Feel free to drop by any week to check it out.  Don’t feel pressured to wait for a semester to start to join.</p>

UT	Jan 27, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibitions program is supported in part by the Lester Robbins and Sheila Johnson Robbins Traveling and Special Exhibition Fund established in 1990. The traveling exhibitions are also supported by Dr. and Mrs. Sol Center.</p>

UT	Jan 27, 2016: Carlos E. Castañeda Postdoctoral Fellow Talk: Alicia Reyes-Barriéntez at Gordon White Building (GWB)	<p>"Evangelicalism and Latinx Political Thought: Do All Latinx Evangelicals Think Alike?”</p>

<p>As the fastest growing minority population in the U.S., Latinxs are an ever-changing demographic group with the potential of altering the electoral landscape in significant ways. Religious diversity could present a challenge to Latinx group cohesion, however, particularly given the growth of Evangelicalism, among both Protestants and Catholics, in the Latino community. Reyes-Barriéntez proposes a theory of Latinx ethno-religious identity politics, which posits that Catholicism, as the religion associated with the larger Latinx identity, reinforces affiliation to the Democratic Party. The extent to which Latinx evangelical Catholics adopt a more conservative ideology and specifically, a preference for the Republican Party, may determine whether or not a sizeable portion of the Latinx electorate will abandon ties to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The dominant tradition in writing about U.S.–Latin American relations during the Cold War views the United States as all-powerful. That perspective, represented in the metaphor “talons of the eagle,” continues to influence much scholarly work down to the present day. The goal of this collection of essays is not to write the United States out of the picture but to explore the ways Latin American governments, groups, companies, organizations, and individuals promoted their own interests and perspectives.</p>

<p>The book also challenges the tendency among scholars to see the Cold War as a simple clash of “left” and “right.” In various ways, several essays disassemble those categories and explore the complexities of the Cold War as it was experienced beneath the level of great-power relations. </p>

UT	Jan 28, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibitions program is supported in part by the Lester Robbins and Sheila Johnson Robbins Traveling and Special Exhibition Fund established in 1990. The traveling exhibitions are also supported by Dr. and Mrs. Sol Center.</p>

<p>For groups of 10 visitors or more, please contact us at least one day ahead of your visit by calling 512-471-0995 or emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@starkcenter.org">info@starkcenter.org</a>.</p>

UT	Jan 28, 2016: Lecture: Lynne Cooke and Ingrid Schaffner at Art Building (ART)	<p>The Department of Art and Art History welcomes Lynne Cooke and Ingrid Schaffner for the 2016 Viewpoint Series.</p>

<p>Lynne Cooke is the senior curator for special projects in Modern Art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. Before arriving at the National Gallery of Art Cooke was deputy director and chief curator at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid (2008–2012); curator at the Dia Art Foundation in New York (1991–2008); artistic director for the 10th Biennale of Sydney (1994–1996); and co-curator of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s 1991 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Exhibitions she has organized include Cristina Iglesias: A Place of Reflection, Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos, Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964–1977, Francis Alÿs, Fabiola, Zoe Leonard: You See I am Here After All, and Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years, co-curated with KynastonMcShine. Cooke wrote essays for the exhibition catalogs Matt Mullican: Subject Element Sign Frame World (Skira/Rizzoli, 2013) and Orthodoxies Undermined, “Great and Mighty Things”: outsider art from the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2013) and authored or written for other exhibition catalogues about the work of artists including:Alighiero Boetti, James Castle, James Coleman, Ann Hamilton, William Kentridge, Willem deKooning, Agnes Martin, and Richard Serra.</p>

<p>Ingrid Schaffner is an American curator, art critic, writer, and educator specializing in art history. Her work often coalesces around themes of archiving and collecting, photography, feminism, and alternate modernisms—especially Surrealism. Since 2000, she has directed the exhibition program as chief curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2018 Schaffner will curate the 57th Carnegie International. She is author of more than 20 books and nearly 200 articles, reviews, and features, ranging from SalvadorDalí’s Dream of Venus to The Essential Andy Warhol, from an essay on exhibition wall text to an art history of chocolate. She has organized monographic exhibitions of the work of KarenKilimnik, Barry Le Va, Jess, Jason Rhoades, and Anne Tyng, among others, and thematic group shows such as The Photogenic, The Puppet Show, Queer Voice, and Dirt on Delight: Impulses that Form Clay.</p>

<p>Schaffner attended Mount Holyoke College and the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program, where she was a Helena Rubinstein Curatorial Fellow. She received a master’s degree in art history at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts.

UT	Jan 29, 2016: The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936  Now Open at the Stark Center  at H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports	<p>The H.J. Lutcher Stark Center in the College of Education and the Texas Program in Sports and Media in the Moody College of Communication are jointly presenting this special museum exhibition created by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Nazi Olympics is a thought provoking visual and multi-media experience exploring the history and impact of  the most controversial of all Olympic Games and it will be on the UT campus  through January 29, 2016. The exhibit is open from 9-5 on weekdays and 11-5 on Saturday and Sunday at the Stark Center in the North End Zone of the football stadium. </p>

<p>Admission for the exhibition is free thanks to gifts from: Kenneth Goldberg, Sandy Gottesman and Kirk Rudy. Media sponsors include Austin American Statesman, KVUE, and KUT 90.1.</p>

<p>The Nazi Olympics documents the treatment of Jews in Germany prior to the Games, how Hitler and the Nazis utilized this celebration of sport as propaganda for their regime, and how other countries, including America, responded.  The Nazi Olympics  demonstrates powerfully the close connections between sport and politics and how the Olympic Games’ are much more than “simply sport.”</p>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibitions program is supported in part by the Lester Robbins and Sheila Johnson Robbins Traveling and Special Exhibition Fund established in 1990. The traveling exhibitions are also supported by Dr. and Mrs. Sol Center.</p>

<p>For groups of 10 visitors or more, please contact us at least one day ahead of your visit by calling 512-471-0995 or emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@starkcenter.org">info@starkcenter.org</a>.</p>

UT	Jan 29, 2016: Texas Law Review Symposium: The Constitution and Economic Inequality at University of Texas School of Law - Jamail Pavilion & Eidman Courtroom	<p>The Texas Law Review at the University of Texas in Austin will be hosting a symposium January 28–30, 2016, Thursday evening to Saturday luncheon, tentatively titled “The Constitution and Economic Inequality.” While the general topic of economic inequality has recently attracted a huge wave of popular and scholarly attention, legal scholars are only now beginning to explore the problem’s constitutional dimensions. This Symposium will change that. We will examine the emerging, many-sided problem of economic inequality in constitutional theory, history, and political economy.
<br />The Texas Law Review is working with Professors Joseph Fishkin and William Forbath to design this event, which will bring together a high-powered group of legal scholars, historians, and other academics to focus on the relationship between the Constitution and our political economy, including arguments that the Constitution depends on preventing oligarchy and preserving a broad, accessible middle class. We are inviting scholars to think about inequality and unequal opportunity in a variety of substantive areas. The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the Texas Law Review.

UT	Jan 29, 2016: Profit from the Ivory Tower? How Businesses Can Turn Eggheads Into Partners at AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center (ATT)	<p>Join McCombs alum and digital marketing vet Ken Cho, UT Associate Professor of Statistics James Scott and UT Associate Professor of Computational Linguistics Jason Baldridge as they talk about overcoming the clash to build a successful company—the real life struggles they have faced, and most importantly, what they have learned from each other.</p>

<p>It used to be that academics were relegated to their corner offices, molding minds on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, attending staff meetings and gaining tenure. They bounced ideas off fellow professors but worked primarily alone, in the classroom, with a pipe and their monocle as their main companions. A professor’s job was to educate, be studious, and above all, to teach the truth.

<br />In a land far, far away lived the marketer, whose job was to tell grandiose stories, to help sell at any cost, even if that sometimes meant…embellishing the truth. Most of them didn’t even know what a quadragram was; their pipes were cigarettes and their monocles were ironic.
<br /> 
<br />But the rise of data creation and the machine marked a huge opportunity for academics—in particular those focused on data science and computation--to embark on a more traditional career. And so something unthinkable happened: the academic and the marketer were forced to inhabit the same space. And while it’s not always smooth sailing, it is always interesting.</p>

<p>This event is co-sponsored by the Jon Brumley Texas Venture Labs, the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Natural Sciences.</p>

UT	Jan 29, 2016: Heather Jarvis: Public Service Loan Forgiveness at Townes Hall (TNH)	<p>Heather Jarvis (askheatherjarvis.com) will be the guest speaker during the 2016 Public Service Career Fair, which will be held January 28-29, 2016 at The University of Texas School of Law.  </p>

<p>Many government and nonprofit professionals stand to gain tens of thousands of dollars of student debt relief from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program established by the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. But the program requirements can be confusing. Heather knows how to break it down step-by-step so it makes sense once and for all. A former capital defense attorney with law school debt, Heather now dedicates her expertise to helping student loan borrowers make better decisions so that higher education can be a reality for all - not just those who can afford it. Specializing in training for high-debt borrowers and the people who love them, Heather has provided guidance and information to thousands of students and alumni.</p>

<p>Students from Texas Law schools as well as students, faculty and staff from UT-Austin are invited to attend.</p>

<p>Lunch will be served. RSVP online.</p>

<p>Lynne Cooke is the senior curator for special projects in Modern Art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. Before arriving at the National Gallery of Art Cooke was deputy director and chief curator at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid (2008–2012); curator at the Dia Art Foundation in New York (1991–2008); artistic director for the 10th Biennale of Sydney (1994–1996); and co-curator of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s 1991 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Exhibitions she has organized include Cristina Iglesias: A Place of Reflection, Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos, Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964–1977, Francis Alÿs, Fabiola, Zoe Leonard: You See I am Here After All, and Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years, co-curated with KynastonMcShine. Cooke wrote essays for the exhibition catalogs Matt Mullican: Subject Element Sign Frame World (Skira/Rizzoli, 2013) and Orthodoxies Undermined, “Great and Mighty Things”: outsider art from the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2013) and authored or written for other exhibition catalogues about the work of artists including:Alighiero Boetti, James Castle, James Coleman, Ann Hamilton, William Kentridge, Willem deKooning, Agnes Martin, and Richard Serra.</p>

<p>Ingrid Schaffner is an American curator, art critic, writer, and educator specializing in art history. Her work often coalesces around themes of archiving and collecting, photography, feminism, and alternate modernisms—especially Surrealism. Since 2000, she has directed the exhibition program as chief curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2018 Schaffner will curate the 57th Carnegie International. She is author of more than 20 books and nearly 200 articles, reviews, and features, ranging from SalvadorDalí’s Dream of Venus to The Essential Andy Warhol, from an essay on exhibition wall text to an art history of chocolate. She has organized monographic exhibitions of the work of KarenKilimnik, Barry Le Va, Jess, Jason Rhoades, and Anne Tyng, among others, and thematic group shows such as The Photogenic, The Puppet Show, Queer Voice, and Dirt on Delight: Impulses that Form Clay.</p>

<p>Schaffner attended Mount Holyoke College and the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program, where she was a Helena Rubinstein Curatorial Fellow. She received a master’s degree in art history at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts.

UT	Jan 30, 2016: Texas Law Review Symposium: The Constitution and Economic Inequality at University of Texas School of Law - Jamail Pavilion & Eidman Courtroom	<p>The Texas Law Review at the University of Texas in Austin will be hosting a symposium January 28–30, 2016, Thursday evening to Saturday luncheon, tentatively titled “The Constitution and Economic Inequality.” While the general topic of economic inequality has recently attracted a huge wave of popular and scholarly attention, legal scholars are only now beginning to explore the problem’s constitutional dimensions. This Symposium will change that. We will examine the emerging, many-sided problem of economic inequality in constitutional theory, history, and political economy.
<br />The Texas Law Review is working with Professors Joseph Fishkin and William Forbath to design this event, which will bring together a high-powered group of legal scholars, historians, and other academics to focus on the relationship between the Constitution and our political economy, including arguments that the Constitution depends on preventing oligarchy and preserving a broad, accessible middle class.

UT	Jan 30, 2016: Sankranti at Main Mall	<p>Namaster Everyone,
<br />We hope everybody had a great winter break! We are kicking off the beginning of this semester with our first HSA event, Sankranti!!!
<br />Makar Sankranti is a Hindu Festival which celebrates the transition from winter to spring. Along with the seasonal transition from harsher, colder winters to more temperate springs, Sankranti also represents a new beginning to many Hindus. To celebrate the arrival of spring (and the passing of the winter solstice), people fly kites toward the sun; this stands as a metaphor for reaching to God.

UT	Feb 1, 2016: Workshop: "Colonialism, Prosperity, and Depression in Late 19th-century Asia," by Mark Metzler at Garrison Hall (GAR)	<p>Mark Metzler is Professor of History and Asian Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.  Dr. Metzler earned his BA in International Relations from Stanford University, his M.A. in Comparative Social History at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and his Ph.D. in East Asian History, at UC Berkeley (1998).  He has performed research at the Faculty of Economics, Osaka City University;  the Institute of Social Science, University of Tokyo;  and most recently at the Institute for Research in Humanities, Kyoto University.  His book Lever of Empire: The International Gold Standard and the Crisis of Liberalism in Prewar Japan (Univ. of California Press, 2006) was the first book in English about the origins of the Great Depression of the 1930s in Japan, and the first study to place that history in a global-historical perspective.  His bookCapital as Will and Imagination: Schumpeter's Guide to the Postwar Japanese Miracle (Cornell Univ. Press, 2013) focuses on postwar Japan as a case study for exploring the nature of modern capitalism in general — specifically, the socially-imagined nature of financial capital and its relationship to the deployment of labor and material resources. In 2013-14 Dr. Metzler served as Program Coordinator at IHS, and co-convened the institute’s three-day conference on "Global Commodity Flows" in April. He is a Fellow at the IHS in 2015-16.</p>

UT	Feb 2, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 2, 2016: Texas Tai Chi at Student Activity Center (SAC) dance room (2.310)	<p>This is a staff interest group — all are welcome: faculty, staff, and students.
<br />No experience is necessary and all levels are welcome. This class will introduce qi gong (breathing), taiji walking exercise, and movements from the Yang-style 24-step form. Be comfortable — wear clothes you can move in. Keep in mind tai chi builds your body awareness because it asks you to consciously move your eyes, hands, arms, waist, and legs all at once — no easy task! Don’t let yourself get frustrated, just try to get a hang of what you can.
<br />There is no set curriculum for the classes, instead it is ongoing practice and learning.  Feel free to drop by any week to check it out.  Don’t feel pressured to wait for a semester to start to join.</p>

UT	Feb 3, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 3, 2016: The Evolution of AI and its Impending Impacts on Law, Ethics, and Global Society with Michael Stewart, founder of Lucid at Peter O'Donnell Jr. Building (POB)	<p>The Robert Strauss Center welcomes Michael Stewart, founder, chairman, and CEO of Lucid, for a conversation on the law, ethics, policy, and future of artificial intelligence. In his talk, "The Evolution of AI and its Impending Impacts on Law, Ethics, and Global Society," Michael Stewart will discuss the development of AI and its various fragmentation forms and functions. He will then look to the landscape of the world's future with pervasive AI, and consider some of the ways in which our current laws and ethics will be challenged. The discussion will end with Mr. Stewart's ideas for how AI will bring about enormous benefits for humanity despite its disruptive challenges.</p>

<p>Michael Stewart is the Chairman, CEO and a Founder of Lucid. He has a long career as an entrepreneur and innovator. As a partner in the Torii Group (2005 to 2009), Mr. Stewart performed consulting services in business change management, enterprise risk management and IT systems for the commercial real estate and insurance industries. As Chairman and CEO of Express Star Systems (1990 to 1998), Mr. Stewart designed software to pioneer the first integrations between CAD systems, relational databases, and business analytic algorithms. These software solutions optimized the operations and asset management needs of large commercial real estate businesses. In the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Mr. Stewart served as a principal systems design specialist for the U.S. government, pioneering next-generation Knowledge Computing and Intelligent Software Agent systems. The sophistication of some components in these complex systems took more than 15 years to fully materialize. Michael returned to government systems design and optimization work from 2001 to 2005.</p>

UT	Feb 4, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 4, 2016: Freedom of Religious Expression: A Panel Discussion at Liberal Arts Building (CLA)	<p>The Free Speech Dialogues were created in order to generate thoughtful, informed discussion of free speech controversies among students. Each semester, a dialogue presents a panel of three speakers offering varying points on a specific free speech battleground.</p>

<p>The event is free and open to the public. </p>

<p>PANELISTS: </p>

<p>Douglas Laycock – Law Professor, University of Virginia and a renowned expert in issues concerning religious freedom</p>

<p>Marci A. Hamilton – Law Professor, Yeshiva University and author of God vs. the Gavel – the Perils of Extreme Religious Liberty</p>

<p>John Corvino – Philosophy Professor, Wayne State University and a leading public intellectual on issues concerning gay rights (earned his PhD here at UT)</p>

<p>PANELISTS WILL CONSIDER SUCH QUESTIONS AS:</p>

<p>How different is religious expression from other types of expression? Should religious speech be treated differently from political speech? from artistic or commercial speech?</p>

<p>Can commercial activities (of a photographer or a floral decorator, for instance) sometimes qualify as speech? </p>

<p>Recent battles seem to pit gay couples’ Equal Protection rights against religious business owners’ rights to religious and expressive freedom. Can a proper understanding of free expression help us cut through this morass?</p>

<p>One man’s religious speech is sometimes another man’s hate speech – in such cases, whose demands should legally prevail?</p>

<p>If a religious organization enjoys public benefits (subsidies, use of government buildings, etc.), may its speech be restricted?</p>

<p>Note: There is a related Essay Contest with cash prizes, open to all undergraduate UT students. Visit the Free Speech website for more information on the associated essay contest.</p>

<p>A Bottle in the Gaza Sea</p>

<p>Thierry Binisti, Israel/France/Canada, 2011, 100 mins
<br />In Hebrew, Arabic and French with English Subtitles
<br />Thursday, February 4, 2016
<br />7:30 PM</p>

<p>In a time of Palestinian suicide-bombers boarding Israeli buses and an ongoing exchange of bombardment for rockets, a young Israeli girl chooses to reach out to someone “on the other side.” Fate intercedes and places Tal’s note into the hands of a young Palestinian. With sarcasm arising from bitterness, Naim answers her plea to understand why some Palestinians are willing to blow themselves up in Israel. She replies in like manner, but with time their emails become more personal and revealing. Eventually their exchange of feelings and ideas removes barriers and leads to changes in each life.</p>

<p>This film is based on the book, which received an honorable mention from the Middle East Book Award (Youth Literature category) in 2008.</p>

UT	Feb 5, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

<p>Between 1883 and 1922, Egypt was visited by no less than five outbreaks of cholera, a virulent disease with spectacular symptomology whose outward spread from the Indian subcontinent was aided by European imperialism and faster transportation technologies. During this period Egypt, though nominally an Ottoman province, was under the control of the British Empire, and Britain's  mission civilisatrice  was well met with the Egyptian government's own modernization initiatives. In the mid-19thcentury, a national medical corps had dispatched throughout the Nile Valley to teach “modern medicine” to the broader population. In poorer urban and rural areas, they met with people whose understanding of disease was rooted in medieval Islamic ideas about epidemic disease, combined with herbal medicine and popular superstitions. </p>

<p>The social fallout from this intersection of competing paradigms can be seen in the headlines of the country's active press: riots took place in front of hospitals, widespread panic and flight were reported, along with more subtle forms of passive resistance to government attempts to control the disease. These stories, however, are absent from Egyptian social histories, which tend to focus on elite populations. </p>

<p>This colloquium presentation will focus on a portion of my dissertation prospectus describing how Islamic understandings of disease, its spread, and prevention provide a new lens into the social disturbances that accompanied the cholera outbreaks of 1883 and 1885 in Egypt.</p>

<p>The Islamic Studies Graduate Colloquium is a forum for discussion that encourages interdepartmental discussions and circulation of ideas among graduate students and professors with an interest in Islamic Studies. We will meet twice a month for a 30-minute presentation followed by comments and questions.  The forum will be coordinated by Dr. Samy Ayoub.</p>

UT	Feb 5, 2016: New York Polyphony at Bates Recital Hall, Music Building (MRH)	<p>Praised for a “rich, natural sound that’s larger and more complex than the sum of its parts,” (National Public Radio) New York Polyphony is regarded as one of the finest vocal chamber ensembles in the world. The four men sing with intelligence, subtlety, and consummate artistry, applying a distinctly modern touch to repertoire that ranges from austere medieval melodies to cutting-edge contemporary compositions. Their dedication to innovative programming, commissioning new works, as well as a focus on rare and rediscovered works, has not only earned New York Polyphony critical acclaim and a devoted following, but also helped to move early music into the classical mainstream.</p>

UT	Feb 6, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 7, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 8, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 9, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

UT	Feb 9, 2016: Texas Tai Chi at Student Activity Center (SAC) dance room (2.310)	<p>This is a staff interest group — all are welcome: faculty, staff, and students.
<br />No experience is necessary and all levels are welcome. This class will introduce qi gong (breathing), taiji walking exercise, and movements from the Yang-style 24-step form. Be comfortable — wear clothes you can move in. Keep in mind tai chi builds your body awareness because it asks you to consciously move your eyes, hands, arms, waist, and legs all at once — no easy task! Don’t let yourself get frustrated, just try to get a hang of what you can.
<br />There is no set curriculum for the classes, instead it is ongoing practice and learning.  Feel free to drop by any week to check it out.  Don’t feel pressured to wait for a semester to start to join.</p>

UT	Feb 10, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 10, 2016: Carlos E. Castañeda Postdoctoral Fellow Talk: Allyson P. Brantley at Gordon White Building (GWB)	<p>'Chicanos Don’t Buy Coors Beer!' Boycotts, Consumerism, and Identity in the Chicana/o Movement, 1965–1987."</p>

<p>This talk examines the changing uses and power of the boycott tool in the Chicana/o movement in the late twentieth century, with special focus on the boycott of Coors beer, which challenged the Coors Brewing Company’s record of workplace discrimination and the Coors family’s conservative politics. Appealing to justice, solidarity, and labor and human rights, this and other boycotts played central roles in the articulation of (and debates over) Chicana/o identity and movement priorities well into the 1980s.</p>

<p>Sponsored by the Center for Mexican American Studies.</p>

UT	Feb 10, 2016: CWGS Faculty Development Program Speaker Series: To Squee, or Not to Squee:  Spreadable Misogyny and the  “Fake Geek Girl” at Liberal Arts Building (CLA)	<p>Dr. Suzanne Scott (Radio-Television-Film)</p>

<p>Through an analysis of the “Idiot Nerd Girl” meme, and its positioning within broader “fake geek girl” discourses, this talk will contend that contemporary efforts to quantify and authenticate fannish affect within male-dominated comic book and video game fandoms are best understood as both a byproduct of, and a backlash against, the mainstreaming of fandom within convergence culture. If, as Henry Jenkins, Sam Ford, and Joshua Green suggest, “spreadable media” is shaping how media is produced and consumed, this talk considers how instances of spreadable misogyny are shaping how the cultural category of the “fan” is being produced and consumed.  Finally, Scott will reassert the feminist project of first wave fan studies through a consideration of how fans (and marginalized fans in particular) stage tactical and transformative interventions into these efforts to contain or “authenticate” geek girls.  In addition to “reclaiming” misogynist memes within geek culture, these efforts range from genderswap fan art that exposes the objectification of female superheroes, to fan-produced folk music that virally functions as a rallying cry against gendered boundary policing practices within fan communities.</p>

UT	Feb 11, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

UT	Feb 11, 2016: Lecture by Janet Richards: Local saints and the power of the past in early Egypt at Art Building (ART)	<p>Janet Richards will explore the dimensions of the saint cult phenomenon as it played out at Abydos, Egypt in the period c. 2200-1650 BC and contextualize the rise to enhanced status and supernatural power of an individual named Idy. Saints like Idy are touchstones of place-bound memory, mobile actors in the rituals and processions of their local landscapes, and the conveyors of blessings on the living.</p>

<p>Janet Richards is professor of Egyptology in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at the University of Michigan. Educated at the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D. in Anthropology and Oriental Studies, 1992), Northwestern University (B.A. in Anthropology and French, 1981),l’École du Louvre, and l’Université de Paris-IV, she specializes in ancient northeast African archaeology and history, with emphasis on conceptual landscapes, ideologies of power, verbal and spatial rhetorics of response to political crisis, the purposes of biography, local saint cults, social transformations over time as materialized in mortuary and votive contexts, and the past as cultural heritage in the past and present. Since 1995 Richards has directed the University of Michigan’s Abydos Middle Cemetery Project in southern Egypt, a large-scale investigation of a late third-early second millennium BC mortuary landscape. She has also participated in excavations in southern Illinois, and at Amarna, Deir el Ballas, and East Karnak, Egypt.</p>

<p>Fish and Cat</p>

<p>Shahram Mokri, Iran, 2013, 134 mins
<br />In Persian with English subtitles
<br />Thursdy, February 11, 2016
<br />7:30 PM</p>

<p>With a nod to the continuous single shot of RUSSIAN ARK, the temporal strategies of Richard Linklater, and the meat cleavers of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Mokri’s film places kite-flying students within easy reach of some sketchy restaurant butchers. Winner for “Innovative Content” at Venice (2013) and nominee in other world film festivals.</p>

UT	Feb 12, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 13, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 14, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 15, 2016: Volunteer: Adults over 18 in a film-making study	<p>My name is Aki and I am a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at Miami University of Ohio. I currently reside in Austin, and am looking for participants for my dissertation project. The project will involve you making a movie about your relationship with nature. "Nature" can be defined broadly; in other words, it could be about you and your pet, your favorite tree, river, trail, or mother nature at large. Your participation is voluntary, and you will have creative control over your movie.</p>

<p>If you participate in this study, you will have the unique opportunity to learn about film medium as a way to explore yourself and your relationship with nature, through the film production itself, as well as multiple conversation with a doctoral-level researcher.</p>

<p>You must be 18 year-old or above. Your participation will entail an initial meeting, and two other interviews in which I will ask you about your relationship with nature and the experience of making the film. </p>

<p>I am looking at a timespan of about 1-3 months for a 5-20 minute-long short film. No prior experience in film-making is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are a UT student, you will be able to loan a video camera from the library. There will also be editing softwares available at the library. </p>

<p>If you are interested or want more information, please contact me, Aki Imai, at <a href="mailto:imaih@miamioh.edu">imaih@miamioh.edu</a>. I'd be excited to have you on board for this exciting project!</p>

<p>The study is supervised by Larry Leitner, Ph.D. and approved by Miami University IRB #00804r.</p>

UT	Feb 15, 2016: Workshop: "Urban Chiaroscuro: Rio de Janeiro and the Politics of Nightfall," by Amy Chazkel at Garrison Hall (GAR)	<p>"In early- and mid-nineteenth- century Rio de Janeiro, the setting sun daily triggered a legal regime distinct from the one that prevailed in daylight: for instance, nightfall turned an artisan carrying a tool into a criminal wielding a weapon, or a free person of color into a presumed slave. Changes in the built environment and urban culture in the early twentieth century attenuated the legal and political importance of nightfall.  Rio’s nightlife attracted—and employed—multitudes from across Brazil and, eventually, the world. Yet the long history of the distinction between day and night bore a lasting impact on the city’s legal culture. This presentation comes from a historical research project that seeks to uncover a crucial but unexplored dimension of the development of the politics of everyday life in a modern city, the analysis of which has dwelled on questions of space but largely ignored time."</p>

<p>Dr. Amy Chazkel (Ph.D. Yale University) is Associate Professor of History at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center. She is the author of Laws of Chance: Brazil’s Clandestine Lottery and the Making of Urban Public Life in Brazil (Duke University Press, 2011). 
<br />Chazkel is also the winner of the New England Council of Latin American Studies Best Book Prize, co-winner of the J. Willard Hurst Prize of the Law and Society Association, and recipient of Honorable Mention for the Best Book Prize of the Brazil Section of the Latin American Studies Association. </p>

<p>Laws of Chance will be published in Portuguese translation in Brazil by Editora da Unicamp. Other publications include articles on penal institutions, illicit gambling, forced labor in post-colonial Brazil and co-edited issues of the Radical History Review that explore the privatization of common property in global perspective and Haitian history. </p>

<p>She has held faculty fellowships and visiting scholar positions at the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition at Yale, the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard, the Institute for Latin American Studies / Center for Brazilian Studies at Columbia, the Center for the Humanities, the Center for Place, Culture and Politics, and the Committee on Globalization and Social Change at the CUNY Graduate Center.</p>

<p>Her projects in progress include a co-edited anthology of primary sources on the history of Rio de Janeiro and research for a book that explores the social, cultural, and legal history of nighttime in nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro.</p>
