Jan 23, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Jan 23, 2016: Nathaniel Hawthorne and Frederick Douglass: Texts and Contexts at Burns Library	<p>Although they are rarely considered in relation to each other, Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Blithedale Romance (1852) and Frederick Douglass’ “The Heroic Slave” (1853) were released about six months apart by publishers located on the same block in downtown Boston. Beyond this, both works were richly interwoven into the fabric of American social, economic, political, literary and cultural life. This exhibition, which began in a Spring 2015 Advanced Topic English Seminar, uses rare books, first editions, and periodicals from the Burns Library’s Boston Collection to explore several of these contexts.</p>

Jan 25, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Jan 27, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Jan 27, 2016: Human Rights and Judicial Independence in Guatemala at McGuinn Hall	<p>With Claudia Escobar, former Guatemalan judge and current Scholar at Risk at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study</p>

<p>Ms. Escobar spoke publicly last year on the acute corruption in the judicial selection process in Guatemala, which was part of a wave of popular revolt against the government that ultimately led to the arrest of the president and vice president of the country on corruption charges. As a result of her brave actions, however, she received threats and was forced to relocate to the US with her family to seek refuge.</p>

Jan 27, 2016: Picosecond Spin Caloritronics at Higgins Hall	<p>David Cahill, Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</p>

<p>Abstract: The coupling of spin and heat gives rise to new physical phenomena in nanoscale spin devices and new ways to manipulate local magnetization. This field of study is typically referred to as “spin caloritronics”. Our work in this field takes advantage of recent advances in the measurement and understanding of heat transport at the nanoscale using ultrafast lasers. We use a picosecond duration pump laser pulses as a source of heat and picosecond duration probe laser pulses to detect changes in temperature, spin accumulation, and spin transfer torque using a combination of time-domain thermoreflectance and time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect Our pump-probe optical methods enable us to change the temperature of ferromagnetic layers on a picosecond time-scale and generate enormous heat fluxes on the order of 100 GW m-2 that persist for ~30 ps.</p>

<p>Thermally-driven ultrafast demagnetization of a perpendicular ferromagnet leads to spin accumulation in a normal metal and spin transfer torque in an in-plane ferromagnet. The data are well described by models of spin generation and transport based on differences and gradients of thermodynamic parameters.</p>

<p>The spin-dependent Seebeck effect of a perpendicular ferromagnetic layer converts a heat current into spin current, which in turn can be used to exert a spin transfer torque (STT) on a second ferromagnetic layer with in-plane magnetization. Using a [Co,Ni] multilayer as the source of spin, an energy fluence of 4 J m-2 creates thermal STT sufficient to induce 1 % tilting of the magnetization of a 2 nm-thick CoFeB layer.</p>

Jan 28, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Jan 30, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 1, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 1, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 2, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 2, 2016: University Ethics: How Colleges Can Build and Benefit from a Culture of Ethics at 24 Quincy Rd.	<p>James Keenan, S.J., Boston College</p>

<p>Stories about ethical issues at universities make headlines every day. From sexual violence to racial conflict, from the treatment of adjuncts to cheating, students, professors, and administrators face countless ethical trials. And yet, very few resources exist to assist universities in developing an ethical culture. University Ethics addresses this challenge and studies different facets of university life—including athletics, gender, faculty accountability, and more—highlights the ethical hotspots, explains why they occur, and proposes best practices. </p>

<p>Professional ethics are a key component of training for numerous other fields, such as business management, medicine, law, and journalism, but there is no prescribed course of study for the academy. Professors and administrators are not trained in standards for evaluating papers, colleagues, boundaries, or contracts. University Ethics not only examines the ethical problems that colleges face one by one but proposes creating an integrated culture of ethics university-wide that fosters the institution’s mission and community.</p>

Feb 3, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 4, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 5, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 6, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture.

Feb 6, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 7, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 7, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 7, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 8, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 8, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 8, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 9, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 9, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 9, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 10, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 10, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 10, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 11, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 11, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 11, 2016: The Treasure of Hispanic Catholicism: Latino/Hispanic Ministry in American Catholicism at Cadigan Alumni Center	<p>American Catholicism welcomed the 21st century in the middle of a major demographic and cultural transformation driven largely by the fast-growing presence of Hispanics, who presently constitute about half of all Catholics in the country. How does such transformation affect our commitments to Catholic ministry, social action, and theological reflection? This presentation reflects on the challenges and possibilities of being Catholic in the United States in an increasingly Hispanic Church.</p>

<p>Marilœ Del Toro is an STM student, and Hosffman Ospino is STM assistant professor of Hispanic ministry and religious education. Moderator, Thomas H. Groome is director of The Church in the 21st Century Center.</p>

Feb 12, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 12, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 12, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 13, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 13, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 13, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 14, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 14, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 14, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 15, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 15, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 15, 2016: The Deans Series: Be Courageously Authentic at Cadigan Alumni Center	<p>Your Jesuit education taught you the importance of being true to yourself and in that, to be men and women for others.</p>

<p>At BC you were surrounded by people and programs that helped support you and encourage you to be your best, authentic self. But sometimes, as years and decades go by, there are fewer support systems, and you may even find yourself feeling alone and lonely in your pursuit of a discerning and ethical life.</p>

<p>This talk will focus on helping you determine what makes you truly authentic. Fr. Burns will explore what it means to be true both to yourself and to others, as well as how you can find ways to incorporate virtues in your life to help you live consistently in harmony with yourself and with God. You will leave refreshed and emboldened to live your life more truly and fully, with coping strategies, a stronger sense of self, more confidence, and a higher likelihood of following through on goals.</p>

<p>Please note that in case of inclement weather on Feb. 15, this event will be held on Feb. 29.</p>

<p>Refreshments will be available beginning at 6 p.m.</p>

Feb 16, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war.

Feb 16, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 16, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 16, 2016: The Grace of Silence and the Power of Words at Corcoran Commons	<p>Award-winning journalist, author, and longtime host and special correspondent for National Public Radio Michele Norris will share the story of how Grace of Silence: A Family Memoir grew out of a journalistic quest to learn how America talked about race. That journey turned into a family history lesson that revealed to Norris her own racial legacy. It also led to her creation of The Race Card Project, winner of the 2014 George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in electronic communication.</p>

Feb 17, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 17, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 17, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 17, 2016: Learning How to Drown at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>Learning How to Drown is a multi-generational love story inspired by the Irish myth of the Selkies, seal people who can shed their skin and become human.</p>

<p>A brewing hurricane has left Emma and John stranded together in Emma’s apartment in NYC for the weekend. John proposes, but when Emma turns him down, their weekend takes an unexpected turn as Emma takes John into the story of her grandparents’ love affair. Suddenly, Emma’s apartment becomes the coast of Ireland, where the lives of a sailor named Aidan and a Selkie named Claire collided 70 years before. Shifting between the present, Emma’s memory, and the love story that has forever shaped her family, Learning How to Drown asks us, do we let the stories our families tell us trap us or set us free?  And how far would you go for love?</p>

Feb 18, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 18, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 18, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 18, 2016: The Stuff of Children's Playthings: Nathaniel Hawthorne's Greek Mythology at Gasson Hall	<p>Professor Sheila Murnaghan, Alfred Reginald Allen Memorial Professor of Greek, Department of Classical Studies, University of Pennsylvania</p>

<p>In two pioneering volumes, A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys (1851) and Tanglewood Tales (1853), Nathaniel Hawthorne transformed classical mythology into pleasure reading for children. As he retold the myths for a new audience, he was clear about the need to suppress darker themes of sexuality and depravity that were present in the mind of the adult story-teller and in the books for adults that he was writing during the same period.  This lecture will examine the rhetorical and visual strategies through which Hawthorne and some of his illustrators negotiated the intersection between childhood ignorance and adult knowledge.</p>

Feb 18, 2016: Learning How to Drown at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>Learning How to Drown is a multi-generational love story inspired by the Irish myth of the Selkies, seal people who can shed their skin and become human.</p>

<p>A brewing hurricane has left Emma and John stranded together in Emma’s apartment in NYC for the weekend. John proposes, but when Emma turns him down, their weekend takes an unexpected turn as Emma takes John into the story of her grandparents’ love affair. Suddenly, Emma’s apartment becomes the coast of Ireland, where the lives of a sailor named Aidan and a Selkie named Claire collided 70 years before. Shifting between the present, Emma’s memory, and the love story that has forever shaped her family, Learning How to Drown asks us, do we let the stories our families tell us trap us or set us free?  And how far would you go for love?</p>

<p>Noonan has created roles in new musicals such as Death Takes a Holiday, Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, Neurosis, Baby Case, Little House on the Prairie, and Signs of Life and seen her plays The Storykeeper and Mermaid People produced by her Alma Mater Boston College.</p>

<p>Jacobs is an award-winning composer and writer whose works include Lily, Truth in Beauty, and Daniel. She is best known for her work on Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, which swept the NYMF awards in 2011 and is premiering at La Mirada Theater in 2015.</p>

Feb 19, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 19, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 19, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 19, 2016: Learning How to Drown at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>Learning How to Drown is a multi-generational love story inspired by the Irish myth of the Selkies, seal people who can shed their skin and become human.</p>

<p>A brewing hurricane has left Emma and John stranded together in Emma’s apartment in NYC for the weekend. John proposes, but when Emma turns him down, their weekend takes an unexpected turn as Emma takes John into the story of her grandparents’ love affair. Suddenly, Emma’s apartment becomes the coast of Ireland, where the lives of a sailor named Aidan and a Selkie named Claire collided 70 years before. Shifting between the present, Emma’s memory, and the love story that has forever shaped her family, Learning How to Drown asks us, do we let the stories our families tell us trap us or set us free?  And how far would you go for love?</p>

<p>Noonan has created roles in new musicals such as Death Takes a Holiday, Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, Neurosis, Baby Case, Little House on the Prairie, and Signs of Life and seen her plays The Storykeeper and Mermaid People produced by her Alma Mater Boston College.</p>

<p>Jacobs is an award-winning composer and writer whose works include Lily, Truth in Beauty, and Daniel. She is best known for her work on Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, which swept the NYMF awards in 2011 and is premiering at La Mirada Theater in 2015.</p>

Feb 20, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 20, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 20, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 20, 2016: Learning How to Drown at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>Learning How to Drown is a multi-generational love story inspired by the Irish myth of the Selkies, seal people who can shed their skin and become human.</p>

<p>A brewing hurricane has left Emma and John stranded together in Emma’s apartment in NYC for the weekend. John proposes, but when Emma turns him down, their weekend takes an unexpected turn as Emma takes John into the story of her grandparents’ love affair. Suddenly, Emma’s apartment becomes the coast of Ireland, where the lives of a sailor named Aidan and a Selkie named Claire collided 70 years before. Shifting between the present, Emma’s memory, and the love story that has forever shaped her family, Learning How to Drown asks us, do we let the stories our families tell us trap us or set us free?  And how far would you go for love?</p>

<p>Noonan has created roles in new musicals such as Death Takes a Holiday, Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, Neurosis, Baby Case, Little House on the Prairie, and Signs of Life and seen her plays The Storykeeper and Mermaid People produced by her Alma Mater Boston College.</p>

<p>Jacobs is an award-winning composer and writer whose works include Lily, Truth in Beauty, and Daniel. She is best known for her work on Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, which swept the NYMF awards in 2011 and is premiering at La Mirada Theater in 2015.</p>

Feb 21, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 21, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 21, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork.

Feb 21, 2016: Learning How to Drown at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>Learning How to Drown is a multi-generational love story inspired by the Irish myth of the Selkies, seal people who can shed their skin and become human.</p>

<p>A brewing hurricane has left Emma and John stranded together in Emma’s apartment in NYC for the weekend. John proposes, but when Emma turns him down, their weekend takes an unexpected turn as Emma takes John into the story of her grandparents’ love affair. Suddenly, Emma’s apartment becomes the coast of Ireland, where the lives of a sailor named Aidan and a Selkie named Claire collided 70 years before. Shifting between the present, Emma’s memory, and the love story that has forever shaped her family, Learning How to Drown asks us, do we let the stories our families tell us trap us or set us free?  And how far would you go for love?</p>

<p>Noonan has created roles in new musicals such as Death Takes a Holiday, Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, Neurosis, Baby Case, Little House on the Prairie, and Signs of Life and seen her plays The Storykeeper and Mermaid People produced by her Alma Mater Boston College.</p>

<p>Jacobs is an award-winning composer and writer whose works include Lily, Truth in Beauty, and Daniel. She is best known for her work on Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice, which swept the NYMF awards in 2011 and is premiering at La Mirada Theater in 2015.</p>

Feb 22, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war.

Feb 22, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 22, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 23, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war.

Feb 23, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 23, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 24, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war.

Feb 24, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 24, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 25, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war.

Feb 25, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 25, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 26, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 26, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 26, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 27, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 27, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 28, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war.

Feb 28, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 28, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Feb 29, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Feb 29, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Feb 29, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 1, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 1, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 1, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 2, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 2, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 2, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Jesus and His Mother at the Wedding in Cana (John 2) at Corcoran Commons	<p>In the Gospel of John, chapter 2, Jesus, his mother, his brothers, and the disciples are at a wedding in Cana, in the Galilee. Inexplicably, the wine runs out early, while the celebrations are in full swing. When Jesus's mother points out the problem to her son, however, he answers in a surprising way: "Woman, what does this have to do with you and me?" This lecture looks closely at this exchange in the context of Jewish and Greco-Roman norms governing parent-child relationships, and considers its role in the Gospel's overall presentation of Jesus.</p>

<p>Adele Reinhartz is Corcoran Visiting Chair in Christian-Jewish Relations at Boston College, and professor, Department of Classics and Religious Studies, at the University of Ottawa.</p>

Mar 2, 2016: Leslie Jamison: The Empathy Exams at Gasson Hall	<p>Lowell Humanities Series Presents Leslie Jamison</p>

<p>Leslie Jamison’s most recent book, a collection of essays called The Empathy Exams, won the 2012 Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize and spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. It’s a book about medical acting, ultra-runners, prison, parasites, silver mines, gang tours, and—beyond and beneath all else—the possibilities, texture, and limits of compassion. The Empathy Exams was named one of the best books of the year by NPR, The New York Times and Publishers Weekly. A graduate of Harvard College and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop Leslie is currently finishing her PhD at Yale University, where she is writing a dissertation on addiction narratives. She has taught courses in fiction and nonfiction at Wesleyan University, Yale University and the New York University School of Journalism. She also mentors through the PEN Prison Writing Program and has worked—for various stints, in various points—as a baker, an office temp, a barista, a medical actor and an innkeeper. She lives with her husband, the novelist Charles Bock, and their daughter in Brooklyn.</p>

Mar 3, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 3, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 3, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 4, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 4, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 4, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 5, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 5, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 5, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 6, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 6, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 6, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 7, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 7, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 7, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 8, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 8, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 8, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 9, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 9, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 9, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 10, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 10, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 10, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 11, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 11, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 11, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 12, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 12, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 12, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 13, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 13, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 13, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 14, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 14, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 14, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 15, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 15, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 15, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Not only does Mark present Jesus as model pray-er, he also emphasizes the significance of prayer for the new family gathered around Jesus, those who are committed to doing God's will.</p>

Mar 16, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 16, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 16, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 17, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 17, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 17, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 17, 2016: Time Stands Still at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>Time Stands Still is set in Brooklyn and revolves around Sarah, a photo journalist who has returned from covering the Iraq war after being injured by a roadside bomb, and her reporter boyfriend James who is swamped by guilt after leaving Sarah alone in Iraq.

Mar 18, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 18, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 18, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 19, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 19, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 19, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 20, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 20, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 20, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 21, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 21, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 22, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 22, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 23, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 23, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 23, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 24, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 24, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 24, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 25, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 25, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 25, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 26, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 26, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 26, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 27, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 27, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 27, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 28, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 28, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 28, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 29, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 29, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 29, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 30, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 30, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 30, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

Mar 31, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Mar 31, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Mar 31, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Mar 31, 2016: The Spirit at Work: St. Teresa of Avila in Life! at Corcoran Commons	<p>A Doctor of the Church, St. Teresa of Avila is widely recognized as divinely inspired in her spiritual writings and her actions in favor of the renewal of the Church. But the presence of the Holy Spirit is as discreet as it is potent. Hence, what can the life and works of Teresa teach us regarding the action of the Spirit? We will explore how the movement of the Spirit can be uncovered through its dynamic imprint as disquieting, kenosis and incarnation, as well as inspiration.</p>

<p>André Brouillette, S.J. is STM assistant professor of systematic and spiritual theology.</p>

Apr 1, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 1, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 1, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 2, 2016: "Blacks in Boston: Black ... and Immigrant" at Gasson Hall	<p>ABOUT THE BLACKS IN BOSTON CONFERENCE</p>

<p>Last held in 2000, the African & African Diaspora Studies Program (AADS) revives its “Blacks in Boston” conference series. The theme for this one-day event is "Blacks in Boston: Black ... and Immigrant.” This theme is designed to engage current issues in the US immigration debate, and to explore what black immigrants and immigration bring to this conversation. Working with a planning committee composed of BC faculty and administrators as well as local community organizations that serve immigrant populations and work for civil rights for residents in Boston and New England, “Blacks in Boston: Black ... and Immigrant” encourages submissions on the following suggested topics:</p>

<p>- Definitions of “black” in sending and receiving countries</p>

<p>- Citizenship and belonging for black Americans</p>

<p>- Making home – social and cultural contributions (Music, Visual</p>

<p>Arts, Literature) to the receiving country</p>

<p>- Immigration as a black civil rights issue</p>

<p>- Waves of black immigration to Boston/New England/New England from the Caribbean, Africa, and Central and South America</p>

<p>- Black, immigrant, and the nation</p>

<p>- Why immigrate? Why New England? (1965 Immigration Act, 1990 Immigration Act [“Diversity Immigrants”], trade/family networks, guest worker programs)</p>

<p> </p>

Apr 2, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 2, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 2, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 3, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 3, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 4, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 4, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 4, 2016: Latin American Intellectual Roots of Pope Francis’s Pontificate at Cadigan Alumni Center	<p>This lecture draws from Fr. Galli’s work as an Argentinian theologian working on various Latin American projects, including his close collaboration with then Cardinal Bergolio in writing the concluding document of Aparecida, the groundbreaking 2007 meeting of Latin American Bishops that mapped the most recent pastoral and theological vision for evangelization on the continent.  This reflection is a journey through the various intellectual, cultural, and ecclesial influences, including the centrality of the “Theology of the People,” that shaped the thought of Pope Francis over the years and today inspires important directions of his pontificate.</p>

<p>Rev. Carlos Maria Galli is professor of theology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and advisor to Pope Francis.</p>

Apr 5, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 5, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 5, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 6, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 6, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 6, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 6, 2016: Poetry Days presents Afaa Michael Weaver at Devlin Hall	<p>Despite the poverty and desperation that surrounded him in the East Baltimore neighborhood where he grew up, Afaa Weaver has forged a life that his sharecropper father perhaps dreamed of for his son. Weaver began writing poetry about love and social justice while studying at the University of Maryland, College Park. By the age of 27, he was publishing consistently in small magazines. His verses, which often presented as dialogue, evolved into writing plays. After receiving an NEA grant, Weaver went on to receive numerous awards, such as the Pew Fellowship in Poetry. His most recent award achievement is the prestigious Kingsley-Tufts Award. Since the early days of getting published, Weaver has authored 12 books of poetry, written numerous essays, and two of his plays have been produced. Weaver is now the Alumnae Professor of English at Simmons College.</p>

Apr 7, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 7, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 7, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 7, 2016: The Challenge of Interreligious Dialogue in the Age of Laudato Si' at Corcoran Commons	<p>THE BRIEN O'BRIEN AND MARY HASTEN LECTURE IN INTERRELIGIOUS DIALOGUE</p>

<p>There is great potential for deepening interreligious dialogue focusing on our shared ecological challenges. The growing ecological crisis clearly requires the response of science and technology, economics and policy.  But we will also need the participation of the world's religious communities as we recognize the moral and spiritual implications of the diminishment of the life support systems of the planet. This talk highlights some of the remarkable work being done within religious communities around the world to bring restoration to people and land. While acknowledging the limitations of religions it also notes the promise for ethical and spiritual transformation regarding ecological attitudes and practices.  Interreligious dialogue has a new and vital role to play in healing the Earth.</p>

<p>Mary Evelyn Tucker is senior lecturer and research scholar, and codirector of the Forum on Religion and Ecology, at Yale University.</p>

Apr 8, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 8, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 8, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 9, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 9, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 9, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 10, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 10, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 10, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 11, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 11, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 11, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 12, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 12, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 12, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 13, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 13, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 13, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 14, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 14, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 14, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 15, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 15, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 15, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 16, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 16, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 16, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 17, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 17, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 17, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 18, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 18, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 18, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 19, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 19, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 19, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 20, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 20, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 20, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 20, 2016: Theology of Pope Francis: Real Reform or Window Dressing at Corcoran Commons	<p>Fifth Annual Dean's Colloquium on Religion and Public Culture</p>

<p>This colloquium takes the form of a conversation about both the content and the style of the papacy of Pope Francis.  While Pope Francis has clearly attracted a ready ear among the Catholic faithful, his efforts to present a more compassionate message to bring back to the Church those who have been alienated from the faith has generated a surprising amount of resistance among the hierarchy, especially among American bishops, who in many respects are his chief critics. The discussion will begin among the panelists who will address these issues, but will move out to include questions and comments from the audience.</p>

<p>Panelists: James Bretzke, S.J., Kristin E. Heyer,Susannah Heschel, Thomas Reese, S.J., and Michael Sean Winters
<br />Moderator: Mark Massa, S.J.</p>

Apr 21, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 21, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 21, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

Apr 22, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 22, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 22, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 23, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 23, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 23, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 24, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 24, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 24, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 25, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 25, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 25, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 26, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 26, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 26, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 27, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 27, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 27, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 28, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 28, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 28, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 28, 2016: The Servant of Two Masters at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>The play opens with the introduction of Beatrice, a woman who has traveled to Venice disguised as her dead brother in search of the man who killed him, Florindo, who is also her lover. Her brother forbade her to marry Florindo, and died defending his sister's honor. Beatrice disguises herself as Federigo, (her dead brother), so that he can collect dowry money from Pantaloon (also spelled Pantalone), the father of Clarice, her brother's betrothed. She wants to use this money to help her lover escape, and to allow them to finally wed. But thinking that Beatrice's brother was dead, Clarice has fallen in love with another man, Silvio, and the two have become engaged. Interested in keeping up appearances, Pantalone tries to conceal the existence of each from the other.</p>

<p>Beatrice's servant, the exceptionally quirky and comical Truffaldino, is the central figure of this play. He is always complaining of an empty stomach, and always trying to satisfy his hunger by eating everything and anything in sight. In one famous scene, it is implied that he eats Beatrice's beloved cat. When the opportunity presents itself to be servant to another master (Florindo, as it happens) he sees the opportunity for an extra dinner.</p>

<p>As Truffaldino runs around Venice trying to fill the orders of two masters, he is almost uncovered several times, especially because other characters repeatedly hand him letters, money, etc. and say simply "this is for your master" without specifying which one. To make matters worse, the stress causes him to develop a temporary stutter, which only arouses more problems and suspicion among his masters. To further complicate matters, Beatrice and Florindo are staying in the same hotel, and are searching for each other.</p>

<p>In the end, with the help of Clarice and Smeraldina (Pantalone's feisty servant, who is smitten with Truffaldino) Beatrice and Florindo finally find each other, and with Beatrice exposed as a woman, Clarice is allowed to marry Silvio. The last matter up for discussion is whether Truffaldino and Smeraldina can get married, which at last exposes Truffaldino's having played both sides all along. However, as everyone has just decided to get married, Truffaldino is forgiven. Truffaldino asks Smeraldina to marry him.</p>

<p>The most famous set-piece of the play is the scene in which the starving Truffaldino tries to serve a banquet to the entourages of both his masters without either group becoming aware of the other, while desperately trying to satisfy his own hunger at the same time.</p>

Apr 29, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 29, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 29, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 29, 2016: The Servant of Two Masters at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>The play opens with the introduction of Beatrice, a woman who has traveled to Venice disguised as her dead brother in search of the man who killed him, Florindo, who is also her lover. Her brother forbade her to marry Florindo, and died defending his sister's honor. Beatrice disguises herself as Federigo, (her dead brother), so that he can collect dowry money from Pantaloon (also spelled Pantalone), the father of Clarice, her brother's betrothed. She wants to use this money to help her lover escape, and to allow them to finally wed. But thinking that Beatrice's brother was dead, Clarice has fallen in love with another man, Silvio, and the two have become engaged. Interested in keeping up appearances, Pantalone tries to conceal the existence of each from the other.</p>

<p>Beatrice's servant, the exceptionally quirky and comical Truffaldino, is the central figure of this play. He is always complaining of an empty stomach, and always trying to satisfy his hunger by eating everything and anything in sight. In one famous scene, it is implied that he eats Beatrice's beloved cat. When the opportunity presents itself to be servant to another master (Florindo, as it happens) he sees the opportunity for an extra dinner.</p>

<p>As Truffaldino runs around Venice trying to fill the orders of two masters, he is almost uncovered several times, especially because other characters repeatedly hand him letters, money, etc. and say simply "this is for your master" without specifying which one. To make matters worse, the stress causes him to develop a temporary stutter, which only arouses more problems and suspicion among his masters. To further complicate matters, Beatrice and Florindo are staying in the same hotel, and are searching for each other.</p>

<p>In the end, with the help of Clarice and Smeraldina (Pantalone's feisty servant, who is smitten with Truffaldino) Beatrice and Florindo finally find each other, and with Beatrice exposed as a woman, Clarice is allowed to marry Silvio. The last matter up for discussion is whether Truffaldino and Smeraldina can get married, which at last exposes Truffaldino's having played both sides all along. However, as everyone has just decided to get married, Truffaldino is forgiven. Truffaldino asks Smeraldina to marry him.</p>

<p>The most famous set-piece of the play is the scene in which the starving Truffaldino tries to serve a banquet to the entourages of both his masters without either group becoming aware of the other, while desperately trying to satisfy his own hunger at the same time.</p>

Apr 30, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

Apr 30, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Apr 30, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Apr 30, 2016: The Servant of Two Masters at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>The play opens with the introduction of Beatrice, a woman who has traveled to Venice disguised as her dead brother in search of the man who killed him, Florindo, who is also her lover. Her brother forbade her to marry Florindo, and died defending his sister's honor. Beatrice disguises herself as Federigo, (her dead brother), so that he can collect dowry money from Pantaloon (also spelled Pantalone), the father of Clarice, her brother's betrothed. She wants to use this money to help her lover escape, and to allow them to finally wed. But thinking that Beatrice's brother was dead, Clarice has fallen in love with another man, Silvio, and the two have become engaged. Interested in keeping up appearances, Pantalone tries to conceal the existence of each from the other.</p>

<p>Beatrice's servant, the exceptionally quirky and comical Truffaldino, is the central figure of this play. He is always complaining of an empty stomach, and always trying to satisfy his hunger by eating everything and anything in sight. In one famous scene, it is implied that he eats Beatrice's beloved cat. When the opportunity presents itself to be servant to another master (Florindo, as it happens) he sees the opportunity for an extra dinner.</p>

<p>As Truffaldino runs around Venice trying to fill the orders of two masters, he is almost uncovered several times, especially because other characters repeatedly hand him letters, money, etc. and say simply "this is for your master" without specifying which one. To make matters worse, the stress causes him to develop a temporary stutter, which only arouses more problems and suspicion among his masters. To further complicate matters, Beatrice and Florindo are staying in the same hotel, and are searching for each other.</p>

<p>In the end, with the help of Clarice and Smeraldina (Pantalone's feisty servant, who is smitten with Truffaldino) Beatrice and Florindo finally find each other, and with Beatrice exposed as a woman, Clarice is allowed to marry Silvio. The last matter up for discussion is whether Truffaldino and Smeraldina can get married, which at last exposes Truffaldino's having played both sides all along. However, as everyone has just decided to get married, Truffaldino is forgiven. Truffaldino asks Smeraldina to marry him.</p>

<p>The most famous set-piece of the play is the scene in which the starving Truffaldino tries to serve a banquet to the entourages of both his masters without either group becoming aware of the other, while desperately trying to satisfy his own hunger at the same time.</p>

May 1, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 1, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 1, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 1, 2016: The Servant of Two Masters at Robsham Theater Arts Center	<p>The play opens with the introduction of Beatrice, a woman who has traveled to Venice disguised as her dead brother in search of the man who killed him, Florindo, who is also her lover. Her brother forbade her to marry Florindo, and died defending his sister's honor. Beatrice disguises herself as Federigo, (her dead brother), so that he can collect dowry money from Pantaloon (also spelled Pantalone), the father of Clarice, her brother's betrothed. She wants to use this money to help her lover escape, and to allow them to finally wed. But thinking that Beatrice's brother was dead, Clarice has fallen in love with another man, Silvio, and the two have become engaged. Interested in keeping up appearances, Pantalone tries to conceal the existence of each from the other.</p>

<p>Beatrice's servant, the exceptionally quirky and comical Truffaldino, is the central figure of this play. He is always complaining of an empty stomach, and always trying to satisfy his hunger by eating everything and anything in sight. In one famous scene, it is implied that he eats Beatrice's beloved cat. When the opportunity presents itself to be servant to another master (Florindo, as it happens) he sees the opportunity for an extra dinner.</p>

<p>As Truffaldino runs around Venice trying to fill the orders of two masters, he is almost uncovered several times, especially because other characters repeatedly hand him letters, money, etc. and say simply "this is for your master" without specifying which one. To make matters worse, the stress causes him to develop a temporary stutter, which only arouses more problems and suspicion among his masters. To further complicate matters, Beatrice and Florindo are staying in the same hotel, and are searching for each other.</p>

<p>In the end, with the help of Clarice and Smeraldina (Pantalone's feisty servant, who is smitten with Truffaldino) Beatrice and Florindo finally find each other, and with Beatrice exposed as a woman, Clarice is allowed to marry Silvio. The last matter up for discussion is whether Truffaldino and Smeraldina can get married, which at last exposes Truffaldino's having played both sides all along. However, as everyone has just decided to get married, Truffaldino is forgiven. Truffaldino asks Smeraldina to marry him.</p>

<p>The most famous set-piece of the play is the scene in which the starving Truffaldino tries to serve a banquet to the entourages of both his masters without either group becoming aware of the other, while desperately trying to satisfy his own hunger at the same time.</p>

May 2, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 2, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 2, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 3, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 3, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 4, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 4, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 4, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 5, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 5, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 5, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 6, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 6, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 6, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 7, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 7, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 7, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 8, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 8, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 8, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 9, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 9, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 9, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 10, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 10, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 10, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 11, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 11, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 11, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 12, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 12, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 12, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 13, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 13, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 13, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 14, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 14, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 14, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 15, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 15, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 15, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 16, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 16, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 16, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 17, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 17, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 17, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 18, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 18, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 18, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 19, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 19, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 19, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 20, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 20, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 20, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 21, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 21, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 21, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 22, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 22, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 22, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 23, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 23, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 23, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 24, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 24, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 24, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 25, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 25, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 25, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 26, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 26, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 26, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 27, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 27, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 27, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 28, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 28, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 28, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 29, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 29, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 29, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 30, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 30, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 30, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

May 31, 2016: 24 Hour News: Paintings by Professor Mary Armstrong, Fine Arts Department at Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library	<p>"These paintings were made as meditations on war, specifically the war in Iraq which began in March 2003. The slow, inexorable march to war was unavoidable.  The White House started to beat the drums, The Congress debated, and the media related these events in the 24 hours a day news cycle. It became a toxic diatribe full of manipulation and despair. Then, the images of torture taking place, in our names, at Abu Ghraib Prison surfaced, and sickened. The series of Paintings that comprise 24 Hour News grew out of those disclosures.  The terrible arrogance of our leaders seemed dangerously absurd as they expressed terrifyingly diabolical frivolity in the face of such cruelty and destruction. When Donald Rumsfeld said, “stuff happens”, I knew we were doomed to endure the “farce of arrogance” in its most devastating and destructive power. Thus, the somewhat unfathomable connection between humor, Eros and violence came into the paintings What’s So Funny?.  The images of the tortured and humiliated bodies from the Abu Graib prison exposed the horrifying lack of protection and sanctity for the bodies of the captured and the victims.  Spine  and Half a Brain express that vulnerability. The Lap paintings were an exasperated attempt to put the female point of view into the picture. The Virgin Mary’s Lap, which normally holds such love and tenderness, now holds the wastes of war. With Launch the Virgin’s lap turns from gory reds to celestial blue, symbolizing her removal from the carnage below."  </p>

May 31, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

May 31, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Jun 1, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Jun 3, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation.

Jun 4, 2016: The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making it Irish at Devlin Hall	<p>During a year of commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, this exhibition offers the first comprehensive examination of the Irish Art and Crafts movement. Like the more familiar Irish Literary Revival, Arts and Crafts practice accompanied and shaped the visual imagination of the country’s transformation from colony to independent nation. As its centerpiece, the exhibition introduces dazzling early medieval-influenced metalwork and embroidered textiles from University College Cork’s Honan Chapel. The collection of this ideologically charged masterpiece of Arts and Crafts achievement, consecrated in 1916, has never before traveled beyond Cork.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features Wilhelmina Geddes’s and Harry Clarke’s stained glass panels that evoke a Celtic and early Christian past, but gesture toward the innovative modernism characterizing the Literary Revival. Other objects on display include handcrafted furniture and metalwork, carpets and wall hangings, and jewelry replicating early medieval metalwork. They illustrate both the widespread popular dissemination of Revivalist motifs and the philanthropic promotion of handicraft industries that initiated the Arts and Crafts movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Major lenders include the National Museum of Ireland, National College of Art and Design, Crawford Art Gallery, National Library of Ireland, Honan Chapel, Ulster Museum, and international private collectors.</p>

<p>The accompanying catalogue, edited by Vera Kreilkamp, contains essays by scholars from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and North America. A digital guide to the exhibition has been produced by Joseph Nugent and students in his digital humanities course.</p>

<p>Organized by the McMullen Museum, the exhibition has been curated by Vera Kreilkamp and Diana Larsen in collaboration with Virginia Teehan (University College Cork) and underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, and an anonymous donor in honor of Colman Welby, with transportation provided by Aer Lingus.</p>

Jun 5, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Jun 6, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Jun 10, 2016: Recreating Identity: The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland at Burns Library	<p>The Arts and Crafts Movement that first emerged in England in the 1880s took on a distinctive character in Ireland, where its aesthetic and social ideals coalesced around the drive to forge a new national identity. Craft and industrial societies were established under the movement’s aegis to promote handpress printing and bookbinding, needlework and lace-making, metalwork and stained glass, and other applied arts. This exhibition complements McMullen Museum’s spring show, “The Arts and Crafts Movement: Making It Irish.”</p>

Jul 22, 2016: Telling Stories about Women at Corcoran Commons	<p>EIGHTH ANNUAL MARY OF MAGDALA CELEBRATION</p>

<p>This celebration of the feast day of St. Mary of Magdala begins with Mass, followed by lunch and a lecture.  A woman hides yeast; a widow threatens a judge; a woman seeks a coin; wise and foolish virgins await a bridegroom….  The parables can be read as universal teachings about theology or salvation.  They should also be read as reflections of women’s lives, indications of women’s agency, and encouragements concerning human relationships.</p>

<p>Amy-Jill Levine is  University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies and E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Professor of New Testament Studies at Vanderbilt University.</p>
