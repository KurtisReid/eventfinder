University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Animals In Antiquity (9/18/2015 - 9/1/2016)	<![CDATA[Animals in Antiquity
A collaborative exhibition between the CU Art Museum and the CU Museum of Natural History 
On view September 18, 2015 - September 2016 
The desire to assign symbolic meanings to animals that share our world links human cultures across time. Whether rendered figuratively or abstractly, depictions of animals remind us not only of themselves but also of the qualities and traits we assign to them. They can illustrate human traitsthe coyote as trickster, the cat aloofand teach children behaviors and ideals from fables. Humans have worshipped animals, hunted and consumed them for food, and altered the natural environments of animals, all in the name of humanity.
This exhibition is a celebration of animals in art and animals as artifacts. The objects are from across the Earth and span the last 4,000 years of human history. We invite you to ponder what these objects represented and how the makers used them in their daily lives.    
Curated by Erin Baxter, doctoral candidate in anthropology
This exhibition is generously supported by the Department of Classics, CU Boulder Student Arts and Cultural Enrichment fees, and CU Art Museum members.]]>	Fri, 18 Sep 2015 06:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=33459&information_id=146258&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	LIBRARIES EXHIBIT  - And there’s the humor of it: Shakespeare and the four humors (12/16/2015 - 1/23/2016)	<![CDATA[William Shakespeare (15641616) created characters that are among the richest and most humanly recognizable in all of literature. Yet Shakespeare understood human personality in the terms available to his agethat of the now-discarded theory of the four bodily humorsblood, bile, melancholy, and phlegm. These four humors were thought to define peoples physical and mental health, and determined their personalities, as well. "And theres the humor of it": Shakespeare and the four humors explores the language of the four humors that bred the core passions of anger, grief, hope, and fearthe emotions conveyed so powerfully in Shakespeares comedies and tragedies.

University of Colorado Boulder	"Children Divided: War Orphans in the Japanese Empire" - Dr. Mariko Asano Tamanoi, UCLA (1/25/2016)	<![CDATA[The Center for Asian Studies and the Department of History Welcomes
Children Divided: War Orphans in the Japanese Empire
CAS Speaker Series - Transcultural Asia
Monday, January 25, 5:00 p.m.
Economics 205, CU-Boulder

This is a talk by Professor Mariko Asano Tamanoi, Department of Anthropology, University of California Los Angeles. Her talk will explore how children displaced by war in both Japan and China came to inspire a transcultural legal discourse on the rights of minors. In the aftermath of World War II, children, especially orphans, were at once divided, protected, and oppressed by different political forces--the Japanese state, the Nationalists and the Communists in China, and the U.S. Occupation Forces. The messy realities surrounding both Japanese and Chinese children were in part created by the idea of the "rights of the child" but also by other novel constructions of the time: "the nation's children," "the empire's children," and "social work" (shakai jigyō). These ideas coexisted with both older visions of "philanthropy" and a new concept of humanitarian aid. How did notions of the universal child (as it was expressed in the phrase "children of the world") take shape in East Asia? In what ways did these notions interact with imperial, national, and social forces? Finally, what distinguishes colonial intervention from humanitarian aids?

Sponsored by the Center for Asian Studies and the Department of History. Brought to you with generous funding from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

University of Colorado Boulder	Nonlinear Waves Seminar - Patrick Shipman (1/26/2016)	<![CDATA[Patrick Shipman, Department of Mathematics, Colorado State University

Topological measures of order for templated pattern-forming systems

When
the surface of a nominally flat binary material is bombarded with a
broad, normally incident ion beam, disordered hexagonal arrays of
nanodots can form.  Defects, such as dislocations in ripple
patterns or penta-hepta pairs in hexagonal arrays, limit
the utility of patterns produced by ion bombardment.  Together with D.
Pearson, F. Motta, and M. Bradley, we have proposed a method, namely
templating the surface, to increase the order in the patterns. To
evaluate the efficacy of this method, a means of quantifying the degree
of order is needed.  We compare time-honored methods, such as the
autocorrelation function, with new topological methods we propose which
utilize persistent homology.   ]]>	Tue, 26 Jan 2016 23:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34598&information_id=149552&type=&rss=rss

New rulers ritually reanimated the acropolis through the emplacement of an elaborate offering that referenced earlier offerings of ensoulment and which included human burials, ceramic vessels, and the probable remains of sacrificial victims, both human and animal. ]]>	Thu, 28 Jan 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34287&information_id=148283&type=&rss=rss

In German-occupied Paris, a young unemployed Algerian named Younes (played by break-out star, Tahar Rahim) earns his living as a black marketeer. Arrested by the French police but given a chance to avoid jail, Younes agrees to spy on the Paris Mosque. The police suspect the Mosque authorities, including its rector Ben Ghabrit, of aiding Muslim Resistance agents and helping North African Jews by giving them false certificates. At the Mosque, Younes meets the Algerian singer Salim Halali, and is moved by Salim's beautiful voice and strong personality. When Younes discovers that Salim is Jewish, he stops collaborating with the police and gradually transforms from a politically ignorant immigrant into a fully-fledged freedom fighter.

Professor Beverly Weber, Associate Professor of German Studies and Jewish Studies, will lead participants in a talkback following the film.]]>	Thu, 28 Jan 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34641&information_id=149660&type=&rss=rss

Outreach, NCAR Despite many advances in LGBTQ rights over the past decade, research shows that many LGBTQ students still experience a chilly climate in universities and in the workplace, which prevents them from reaching their full potential, and can take a toll on mental and physical health. This workshop explores the research around the policy and social barriers facing LGBTQ students in higher education, and ways that we can all help to create a warm and welcoming environment in our classrooms, departments, and institutions.

Daria Kotys-Schwartz, Director, Idea Forge; Instructor, Mechanical Engineering
Research has shown that Project-Based Learning (PBL) has several benefits in STEM classrooms. Due to the broad variety of practices classified as PBL, results can be wide-ranging and confusion can easily occur when reviewing the literature. This workshop will introduce the difference between PBL and an add-on project in a course. We will discuss relevant PBL research, the critical components for supporting PBL, and the potential outcomes.

12:00 - 12:50

Dr. Nichole Barger


First Contact with Global Science: A Scientists Perspective on IPBES Engagement


A large number of global assessments will be undertaken by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) over the next several years providing unique opportunities for global science policy engagement for early career scientists. This presentation describes my experience with IPBES engagement over the past year, potential barriers to participation by US experts, and strategies for overcoming barriers to participation in these critically important policy relevant global assessments.

The lunch hour brown bag series offers an opportunity for graduate students, post-docs, research assistants, and faculty in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department to present current research, stories of recent travels to conduct scientific work, or other science related topics. This forum is an excellent opportunity (especially for graduate students) to gain valuable feedback on concepts, methods, statistical analyses, and many other aspects of their work. Brown bag has an informal atmosphere that fosters dynamic discussions and friendly conversation.]]>	Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34660&information_id=149730&type=&rss=rss

Becoming a self-starter mainly requires two things: reading and starting the day a little earlier than the others. This workshop provides certain steps to help you be a self-starter who initiates things rather than waiting for someone else to do it.

University of Colorado Boulder	Close Looking: details from our collection (2/12/2016)	<![CDATA[Close Looking: details from our collection
An exhibition curated by the CU Art Museum and presented as part of BMoCA at Macky
On view January 11 - February 28, 2016
What makes a museum? For us at the CU Art Museum an important pillar is our collection of over 8,000 objects spanning human history. Each photograph in this exhibition is a highly magnified detail of an object in our collection; each one selected by a different member of our museum staff. These objects inspire usfrom small ancient coins to large contemporary paintingsand the personal connections we make with them inform how we look at the collection as a whole.
This project illustrates our desire to promote new ways of looking at our collection. Interested in seeing more?

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (2/12/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (2/12/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

Please
see the VCRs Innovative Seed Grant Program Page at: https://www.colorado.edu/vcr/fundingawards/innovative-seed-grant-program. 
 
We are
looking for research, scholarship, and creative projects that:

    Involve new interdisciplinary initiatives that take investigators
    in creative, and sometimes high-risk, high-reward directions including
    team development proposals for future large team research projects
    Have tangible payoffs in terms of future funding, scholarly or
    artistic impact, or development of new productive collaborations

 
The projects may take a variety of forms but
must represent an investment in the future research, scholarly, or artistic
vitality of the university and demonstrate promise for expansion of the project
goals in the future. The projects can come from any discipline at the
university, with those involving interdisciplinary work that will foster
collaborative interaction among CU faculty particularly welcome. We would like
to stress that proposals are judged in categories designed to allow faculty
from all disciplines the opportunity to compete successfully, even if their
discipline is not traditionally connected to sponsored research. We especially
welcome proposals for work in emerging fields. 

This year, there is a new and unique
opportunity for faculty who would like to become part of the campus Grand
Challenge supporting Our Space. Our Future. and take the
Challenge into new and exciting directions. Funding has been set aside for
projects that branch out and strengthen the ongoing work and contribute to
ensuring a global impact on our goals of improving our reputation, diversifying
our revenue streams, and ensuring student success. These projects need to be
distinctive from and synergistic with the Grand Challenge projects already
underway. Applicants should clearly identify if their submitted proposal is in
support of the Grand Challenge and how it will address and strengthen the goals
of the university.]]>	Sun, 14 Feb 2016 07:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34515&information_id=149339&type=&rss=rss

February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (2/16/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	AIA Lecture Series: Saint Peter in Rome: A Historian’s Perspective (2/17/2016)	<![CDATA[


	Join Dr. Tyler Lansford, author and instructor within the CU Department of Classics as he explains the Petrine tradition in its historical and archaeological context in "St. Peter in Rome: A Historian's Perspective.
	During the early Christian centuries, the tradition that the apostle Peter had ministered and died in Rome formed a leading component of Rome's claim to ecclesiastical primacy within the church universal.  As early as the second century, the Christian community of Rome identified a site where Peter was believed to be buried: progressively monumentalized, the memoria Petri (Tomb of Peter) today lies directly below the high altar of St. Peter's Basilica.

An exhibition curated by the CU Art Museum and presented as part of BMoCA at Macky
On view January 11 - February 28, 2016
What makes a museum? For us at the CU Art Museum an important pillar is our collection of over 8,000 objects spanning human history. Each photograph in this exhibition is a highly magnified detail of an object in our collection; each one selected by a different member of our museum staff. These objects inspire usfrom small ancient coins to large contemporary paintingsand the personal connections we make with them inform how we look at the collection as a whole.
This project illustrates our desire to promote new ways of looking at our collection. Interested in seeing more? Visit the museum, located at the Visual Arts Complex, to make your own personal connections.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (2/18/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (2/18/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (2/22/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	St. John's Dr. Ian Miller - “Text Modeling the Emperor’s Archives..." (2/22/2016)	<![CDATA[EXPLORING DIGITAL HUMANITIES: A Lecture Series on Research and Pedagogy
 
Associate Professor, Ian Matthew Miller
St. Johns University
 
Text Modeling the Emperors Archives: Exploring Digital Approaches to Chinese History
 
Center for British and Irish Studies, Norlin Library 5th floor
Monday Feb 22, 5-6:30 p.m.
 
Premodern China offers an almost unparalleled body of texts ripe for digital  analysis: hundreds of years of court and private records compiled by an infamously  large and highly literate bureaucracy, many of which have since been digitized. Yet  premodern Chinese texts pose their own set of issues  both legal and linguistic. In  this talk, Miller will detail some of the issues encountered in text modeling two  different corpora: a set of 300 thousand entries in the records of the imperial court;  and a set of more than 600 genealogical essays in private collections. Miller will  explore how text modeling allows historians to capture and analyze topics across  very large numbers of texts, but also raises questions about the nature of the data  captured through these automated models.
 
About Dr. Miller:

Ian Matthew Miller is a historian of pre-modern China. His work focuses on long-term social, intellectual, and environmental change, often through the application  of digital methods. Trained at Harvard University, he has recently joined the faculty  at St. Johns University, where he is assistant professor in the Department of History.  Professor Millers interests include banditry and unrest, genealogy, tax policy, and  food history. His current project focuses on land ethics and wood rights in South  China.

Symbolic Computation of Scaling Invariant Lax Pairs in Operator Form for Completely Integrable Systems

Based on scaling symmetry properties, a direct method to
compute Lax pairs in operator form for completely integrable systems
will be presented.

By splitting the determining equations for the Lax pair into kinematic
and dynamical constraints, the problem can eventually be reduced to
solving nonlinear algebraic equations.

The method will be illustrated with well-known examples from soliton
theory and applied to a three parameter class of fifth-order KdV-like
evolution equations.]]>	Tue, 23 Feb 2016 23:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34598&information_id=149556&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (2/24/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (2/24/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (2/27/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (2/27/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Nonlinear Waves Seminar - Baowen Li (3/1/2016)	<![CDATA[Baowen Li, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder

Phononics: manipulating phonons with electronic analog


The discovery of electronic transistor has changed our daily life in many aspects. However, a similar device to manipulate phonons  the main heat carriers in semiconductor and dielectric materials- has not yet available.
About a decade ago, we proposed a thermal diode model to rectify heat flux due to phonons in nanoscale [1]. A great progress has been achieved in this rapid developing field, including the experimental realization of solid-state thermal rectifier[2], thermal transistor model [3], and a new emerging field  Phononics [4]. 
In this talk, I will give an overview of past years development in this direction. Emphasis will be given on the fundamental principle of thermal diode, and the extension of thermal diode concept to control other energy forms including elastic energy, acoustic waves, heat carried by electrons, photons and magnons etc. 
I will also present the underlying physical mechanism for negative differential thermal resistance  - an essential physical principle of building thermal transistor. The thermal transistor function like switch and amplifier will be demonstrated.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (3/2/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/2/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Content Conference: Innovation and Incentives in the Creative Arts (3/3/2016)	<![CDATA["Innovation" is often hailed as the north star in the law and technology and intellectual property communities. In patent law, for example, the focus is often on how certain types of legal protections can encourage inventors and investors. As highlighted by the copyright limit term debate, copyright law must also grapple with the core question of which incentives are necessary to motivate creative innovation; that is, who should make money from artistic creation, when, how, and for how long. But copyright law also explicitly introduces other, non-economic considerations into the mix, including protecting the rights of users (including other artists) in some cases, and that of encouraging investors in others. Taking a step back from current copyright controversies, this conference will examine the question of innovation and incentives in the creative arts through three lenses: (1) the perspective of the artists; (2) the perspective of the creative industries; and (3) the academic literature on how the various incentives work in practice.]]>	Thu, 3 Mar 2016 20:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34487&information_id=149224&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (3/5/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/5/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

By bridging the gap between humanities, social sciences, and science we can place students at the center of the learning process and allow them to develop essential lifelong learning and critical thinking skills. We will use examples from several disciplines and will work on placing new ideas into a less traditional field.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (3/8/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/8/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Complex/Dynamical Systems Seminar: Safe Leads and Lead Changes in Competitive Team Sports (3/10/2016)	<![CDATA[Aaron Clauset, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder

In this talk, we will investigate the time evolution of lead changes within individual games of competitive team sports. Exploiting ideas from the theory of random walks, we first show that the number of lead changes within a single game follows a Gaussian distribution. We then show that the probability that the last lead change and the time of the largest lead size are governed by the same arcsine law, a bimodal distribution that diverges at the start and at the end of the game. Finally, we derive a simple formula for the probability that a given lead is "safe", i.e., will not be overturned by the end of the game, as a function of its size L and game time t. Using comprehensive data on more than 1.25 million scoring events in roughly 40,000 games across four professional or semi-professional team sports, we find that our predictions are generally in excellent agreement with real data, and are more accurate than popular heuristics currently used in sports analytics.

February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/11/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (3/15/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/15/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Be Here Now (3/18/2016)	<![CDATA[Be Here Now: Conversations Between Objects
February 12March 19, 2016
Be Here Now is the second exhibition in a series subtitled Conversations Between Objects, which provokes a dialogue between artworks that span different time periods and geographic locations.
Setting the stage for this exhibition of recent acquisitions are the photographs of Lou Stoumen (191792), which consider the fragile nature of the human body expressed through the objects we create and their inevitable deterioration over time. These black-and-white images document human intimacies, labor, leisure and loss from all over the United States and elsewhere in the world.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/18/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/23/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Rabbit Hole (3/30/2016)	<![CDATA[By David Lindsay-Abaire
Directed by Wesley Longacre

There is always light at the end of the tunnel. Rabbit Hole follows a couple trying to find that light in the midst of a life-altering tragedy.  David Lindsay Abaire's Pulitzer Prize-winning play charts a search for hope in the midst of unthinkable darkness and the ways we continue on in the face of heartbreaking circumstances. 

"Almost unbearable to watch at times is its insistence on presenting a tragedy and its consequences with utter candor, and without sentimentality. I don't frequently advise people to pay good money to have their hearts broken, but trust me on this one."

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (3/31/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (4/4/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (4/8/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (4/12/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (4/16/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (4/30/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (5/5/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (5/11/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (5/19/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (5/31/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (6/7/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	The Comedy of Errors - Colorado Shakespeare Festival (6/11/2016)	<![CDATA[By William Shakespeare
Directed by Geoffrey Kent
From the creative mind behind the CSFs triumphant A Midsummer Nights Dream (2013), The Comedy of Errors is Shakespeares purest comedywith a twist. Set in jazzy, sexy 1930s Paris, this hilarious new production bends the classic adventure of mistaken identities in a different direction that puts the women in charge...and the men in their places. Sultry singing, cabaret nightlife, puns and punchlines, this is Comedy, inside out. ]]>	Sun, 12 Jun 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34201&information_id=148088&type=&rss=rss

February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	The Comedy of Errors - Colorado Shakespeare Festival (6/18/2016)	<![CDATA[By William Shakespeare
Directed by Geoffrey Kent
From the creative mind behind the CSFs triumphant A Midsummer Nights Dream (2013), The Comedy of Errors is Shakespeares purest comedywith a twist. Set in jazzy, sexy 1930s Paris, this hilarious new production bends the classic adventure of mistaken identities in a different direction that puts the women in charge...and the men in their places. Sultry singing, cabaret nightlife, puns and punchlines, this is Comedy, inside out. ]]>	Sun, 19 Jun 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34201&information_id=148089&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (6/24/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	The Comedy of Errors - Colorado Shakespeare Festival (7/2/2016)	<![CDATA[By William Shakespeare
Directed by Geoffrey Kent
From the creative mind behind the CSFs triumphant A Midsummer Nights Dream (2013), The Comedy of Errors is Shakespeares purest comedywith a twist. Set in jazzy, sexy 1930s Paris, this hilarious new production bends the classic adventure of mistaken identities in a different direction that puts the women in charge...and the men in their places. Sultry singing, cabaret nightlife, puns and punchlines, this is Comedy, inside out. ]]>	Sun, 3 Jul 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34201&information_id=148090&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	Exhibition: Janelle Iglesias (7/5/2016)	<![CDATA[Janelle Iglesias: Even a Simple Call Can Turn Into a Complex Racket
February 12July 9, 2016
Janelle Iglesias is the CU Art Museums inaugural artist-in-residencea program in which artists are invited to mine CU-Boulders creative and intellectual resources and collaborate with faculty and students to produce new artwork. Fascinated by the human impulse to collect and throw things away, Janelle is always on the lookout for natural and cultural artifacts that present an archeology of place. She amasses materials like driftwood, Styrofoam and glass that have been processed by time and nature and up-cycles them into intricate environments. Janelle will incorporate actual and copied objects from CU-Boulders various collections, including the Museum of Natural History, the Evolutionary and Ecology Greenhouse and trees on campus, into an ever-evolving sculptural installation. Her mechanisms of display employ translation, mimicry, and mirroring to heighten the interconnectedness of things and people. The museum will become a flexible space: a site for viewing and performance, a think tank and a playground, where audiences can interact with the artist and participating students as they transform the gallery over time.

University of Colorado Boulder	The Comedy of Errors - Colorado Shakespeare Festival (7/9/2016)	<![CDATA[By William Shakespeare
Directed by Geoffrey Kent
From the creative mind behind the CSFs triumphant A Midsummer Nights Dream (2013), The Comedy of Errors is Shakespeares purest comedywith a twist. Set in jazzy, sexy 1930s Paris, this hilarious new production bends the classic adventure of mistaken identities in a different direction that puts the women in charge...and the men in their places. Sultry singing, cabaret nightlife, puns and punchlines, this is Comedy, inside out. ]]>	Sun, 10 Jul 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34201&information_id=148091&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	Troilus and Cressida (7/17/2016)	<![CDATA[ Life every man holds dear; but the dear man holds honor far more precious dear than life.
Directed by Carolyn Howarth

God-like heroes, embattled kings, doomed love, and a sinister, snarky clown make Shakespeares epic of the Trojan War one of his greatest legends. Like grown-up versions of Romeo and Juliet all too familiar with lifes stark realities, the eponymous lovers face painful choices in this mythic mlange of drama, comedy and history.

University of Colorado Boulder	The Comedy of Errors - Colorado Shakespeare Festival (7/20/2016)	<![CDATA[By William Shakespeare
Directed by Geoffrey Kent
From the creative mind behind the CSFs triumphant A Midsummer Nights Dream (2013), The Comedy of Errors is Shakespeares purest comedywith a twist. Set in jazzy, sexy 1930s Paris, this hilarious new production bends the classic adventure of mistaken identities in a different direction that puts the women in charge...and the men in their places. Sultry singing, cabaret nightlife, puns and punchlines, this is Comedy, inside out. ]]>	Thu, 21 Jul 2016 02:00:00 GMT	Uncategorized	http://events.colorado.edu/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=34201&information_id=148094&type=&rss=rss

University of Colorado Boulder	Troilus and Cressida (7/21/2016)	<![CDATA[ Life every man holds dear; but the dear man holds honor far more precious dear than life.
Directed by Carolyn Howarth

God-like heroes, embattled kings, doomed love, and a sinister, snarky clown make Shakespeares epic of the Trojan War one of his greatest legends. Like grown-up versions of Romeo and Juliet all too familiar with lifes stark realities, the eponymous lovers face painful choices in this mythic mlange of drama, comedy and history.
